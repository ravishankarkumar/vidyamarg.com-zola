This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile app for JEE/NEET preparation, currently in development and soon to be available on iOS and Android.\n1. Information We Collect\nThe Vidya Marg mobile app may collect the following types of information:\n\nPersonal Information: When you sign up for our beta testing program via Telegram, we may collect your name, email address, and Telegram username to manage your participation.\nUsage Data: We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the app, such as lessons viewed, practice problems attempted, time spent, and navigation patterns. This helps us improve the app’s features and user experience.\nDevice Information: We may collect device details (e.g., device type, operating system, unique device identifiers) to optimize the app’s performance and ensure compatibility.\nNotifications Data: If you enable push notifications, we may collect data to send you updates about new content, exam tips, or reminders. This includes tokens or identifiers required for notification delivery.\nAnalytics Data: We use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect usage data. These tools may use cookies or similar technologies to track app usage.\n\nWe do not collect sensitive data such as location, camera, or microphone access at this time. If such features are added in the future, we will update this policy and request your consent where required.\n2. How We Use Your Information\nWe use your information to:\n\nProvide core app functionality, such as delivering interactive lessons, practice problems, offline access, and progress tracking.\nSend push notifications (if enabled) about new content, reminders, or updates.\nCommunicate with you about beta testing, app updates, or new features.\nAnalyze usage patterns to enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.\nEnsure the security of the app and prevent misuse.\n\nWe do not use your data for purposes unrelated to the app’s functionality. If such usage is introduced, we will disclose it clearly and obtain your affirmative consent.\n3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services\n\nThird-Party Analytics: We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymized usage data. This tool may collect device information and usage patterns. Their privacy practices are governed by their Privacy Policy.\nNotification Services: We may use third-party services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) to deliver push notifications. These services may process notification tokens or identifiers.\nService Providers: We may share data with service providers (e.g., hosting providers) to operate the app. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.\nLegal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of Vidya Marg or others.\nNo Third-Party Marketing: We do not share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.\n\n4. Data Retention and Deletion\n\nRetention: We retain personal information (e.g., beta tester details) only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, typically until the beta testing program concludes or you request deletion.\nAccount Deletion: If you create an account in the app, you can request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us (see Section 8). We will delete your data within 30 days of your request, except where required to retain it by law (e.g., for legal compliance).\nUsage Data: Anonymized usage data may be retained indefinitely to improve the app, but it cannot be linked to you personally.\nData Portability: Upon request, we can provide a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable format, where feasible.\n\n5.
