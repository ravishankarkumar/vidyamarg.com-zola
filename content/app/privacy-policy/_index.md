# Privacy Policy - Vidya Marg Mobile App

*Last Updated: May 23, 2025*

At Vidya Marg, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile app for JEE/NEET preparation, currently in development and soon to be available on iOS and Android.

## 1. Information We Collect

The Vidya Marg mobile app may collect the following types of information:

- **Personal Information**: When you sign up for our beta testing program via Telegram, we may collect your name, email address, and Telegram username to manage your participation.
- **Usage Data**: We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the app, such as lessons viewed, practice problems attempted, time spent, and navigation patterns. This helps us improve the app’s features and user experience.
- **Device Information**: We may collect device details (e.g., device type, operating system, unique device identifiers) to optimize the app’s performance and ensure compatibility.
- **Notifications Data**: If you enable push notifications, we may collect data to send you updates about new content, exam tips, or reminders. This includes tokens or identifiers required for notification delivery.
- **Analytics Data**: We use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect usage data. These tools may use cookies or similar technologies to track app usage.

We do not collect sensitive data such as location, camera, or microphone access at this time. If such features are added in the future, we will update this policy and request your consent where required.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide core app functionality, such as delivering interactive lessons, practice problems, offline access, and progress tracking.
- Send push notifications (if enabled) about new content, reminders, or updates.
- Communicate with you about beta testing, app updates, or new features.
- Analyze usage patterns to enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.
- Ensure the security of the app and prevent misuse.

We do not use your data for purposes unrelated to the app’s functionality. If such usage is introduced, we will disclose it clearly and obtain your affirmative consent.

## 3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services

- **Third-Party Analytics**: We use Google Analytics for Firebase to collect anonymized usage data. This tool may collect device information and usage patterns. Their privacy practices are governed by their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Notification Services**: We may use third-party services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) to deliver push notifications. These services may process notification tokens or identifiers.
- **Service Providers**: We may share data with service providers (e.g., hosting providers) to operate the app. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of Vidya Marg or others.
- **No Third-Party Marketing**: We do not share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Retention**: We retain personal information (e.g., beta tester details) only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, typically until the beta testing program concludes or you request deletion.
- **Account Deletion**: If you create an account in the app, you can request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us (see Section 8). We will delete your data within 30 days of your request, except where required to retain it by law (e.g., for legal compliance).
- **Usage Data**: Anonymized usage data may be retained indefinitely to improve the app, but it cannot be linked to you personally.
- **Data Portability**: Upon request, we can provide a copy of your personal data in a machine-readable format, where feasible.

## 5. Data Protection

- We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest, to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.
- Personal information is stored securely on servers managed by reputable hosting providers, accessible only to authorized personnel involved in app development and beta testing.
- We regularly review and update our security practices to ensure your data remains safe.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

- **Push Notifications**: You can enable or disable push notifications through your device settings or within the app.
- **Beta Testing Communications**: You can opt out of beta testing communications by contacting us via Telegram.
- **Access and Deletion**: You can request access to or deletion of your personal information by contacting us (see Section 8). We will respond within 30 days.
- **Analytics**: You can opt out of analytics tracking through your device settings, though this may affect app functionality.
- **GDPR and CCPA Compliance**: If you are in the EU or California, you have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data, as well as to opt out of data sharing. Contact us to exercise these rights.
- **Consent for Sensitive Data**: If we introduce features requiring sensitive data (e.g., location), we will request your explicit consent before collection.

## 7. Third-Party Links

The app may contain links to third-party services (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, Telegram) for lesson videos, updates, or communication. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review their privacy policies before interacting with them.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The Vidya Marg app is intended for users preparing for JEE/NEET exams, typically aged 16 and above. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to have it removed.

## 9. International Data Transfers

Your data may be transferred to and stored in servers outside your country, including in the United States, where our service providers (e.g., Google Analytics) operate. We ensure these transfers comply with applicable data protection laws, using safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses where required.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the app develops or to comply with legal requirements. Changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated via in-app notifications or email (for beta testers). We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
