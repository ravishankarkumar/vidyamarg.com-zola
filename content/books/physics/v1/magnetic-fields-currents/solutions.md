## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A current element $I = 5 \, \text{A}$, $dl = 0.02 \, \text{m}$ is at a distance $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$ (perpendicular). Calculate the magnetic field $dB$ ($\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$).  
- (a) $9.99 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{T}$  
- (b) $1.00 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}$  
- (c) $1.01 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $1.02 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field due to a small current element is given by the Biot-Savart law: $dB = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{4 \pi r^2}$, where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $I$ is the current, $dl$ is the length of the current element, $r$ is the distance from the element to the point, and $\theta$ is the angle between the current element and the position vector. Here, $I = 5 \, \text{A}$, $dl = 0.02 \, \text{m}$, $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$, and $\theta = 90^\circ$ (perpendicular), so $\sin \theta = 1$. Given $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$:  
$$
dB = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 5 \times 0.02 \times 1}{4 \pi \times (0.1)^2} = \frac{4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 5 \times 0.02}{4 \pi \times 0.01} = \frac{10^{-8}}{0.01} = 10^{-8} \times 10^2 = 1.00 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}
$$
The answer is (b) $1.00 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Ensure $\sin \theta = 1$ for perpendicular orientation; $dB$ is small for a short element and requires integration for finite wires. Common error: Forgetting to square $r$ in the denominator.

### Solution 3
**Problem**: A circular loop of radius $R = 0.05 \, \text{m}$ carries $I = 3 \, \text{A}$. Calculate the magnetic field at the center of the loop.  
- (a) $3.76 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (b) $3.77 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (c) $3.78 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $3.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field at the center of a circular loop of radius $R$ carrying current $I$ is given by $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$, where $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$ is the permeability of free space. Given $R = 0.05 \, \text{m}$ and $I = 3 \, \text{A}$:  
$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R} = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 3}{2 \times 0.05} = \frac{4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 3}{0.1} = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 30 = 1.2 \pi \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.2 \times 3.1416 \times 10^{-5} \approx 3.7699 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}
$$
Round to two decimal places: $3.77 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$. The answer is (b) $3.77 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The field is stronger for smaller $R$; use the right-hand rule to determine direction (perpendicular to the loop plane). Common error: Using the formula for a straight wire or incorrect $R$.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What does the Biot-Savart law calculate?  
- (a) Electric field due to a current  
- (b) Magnetic field due to a current element  
- (c) Electric field due to a charge  
- (d) Magnetic field due to a static charge

**Solution**:  
The Biot-Savart law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism that describes the magnetic field generated by a current. Specifically, it calculates the magnetic field contribution $d\vec{B}$ at a point due to an infinitesimal current element $I d\vec{l}$, given by $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (d\vec{l} \times \hat{r})}{r^2}$. This law applies to any current distribution, requiring integration over the entire current path to find the total field. It does not calculate electric fields, which are associated with charges (via Coulomb’s law for static charges) or changing magnetic fields (via Faraday’s law). A static charge does not produce a magnetic field, as magnetic fields require moving charges (currents).  
- (a) Incorrect: The Biot-Savart law calculates magnetic fields, not electric fields; electric fields from currents involve more complex scenarios like displacement currents.  
- (b) Correct: The Biot-Savart law calculates the magnetic field due to a current element.  
- (c) Incorrect: Electric fields due to charges are calculated using Coulomb’s law, not the Biot-Savart law.  
- (d) Incorrect: A static charge does not produce a magnetic field; motion (current) is required.  
The answer is (b) Magnetic field due to a current element.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The Biot-Savart law is for magnetic fields from currents; distinguish it from Coulomb’s law for electric fields. Common error: Confusing magnetic and electric field sources.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What is the relationship between the magnetic field and distance from an infinite straight wire?  
- (a) $B \propto r$  
- (b) $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$  
- (c) $B \propto r^2$  
- (d) $B \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field due to an infinite straight wire carrying current $I$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ is given by $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$, derived using either the Biot-Savart law or Ampere’s law. This formula shows that the magnetic field $B$ is inversely proportional to the distance $r$ from the wire: $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$. The field forms circular loops around the wire, and its magnitude decreases as you move farther away, consistent with the $1/r$ dependence. A linear dependence ($B \propto r$) would imply the field increases with distance, which is incorrect. A $1/r^2$ dependence is typical for point sources (like a small current element or electric field from a point charge), not an infinite wire, and $r^2$ dependence does not apply here.  
- (a) Incorrect: $B \propto r$ would mean the field increases with distance, which is not true.  
- (b) Correct: $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$, as per the formula for an infinite wire.  
- (c) Incorrect: $B \propto r^2$ would imply the field increases quadratically, which is incorrect.  
- (d) Incorrect: $B \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$ applies to point sources, not an infinite wire.  
The answer is (b) $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The $1/r$ dependence is unique to infinite straight wires; compare with $1/r^2$ for point sources. Common error: Confusing with electric field dependence ($1/r^2$ for a point charge).

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the magnetic field due to a small current element using the Biot-Savart law $dB = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{4 \pi r^2}$.

**Solution**:  
The Biot-Savart law gives the magnetic field $d\vec{B}$ at a point due to a current element $I d\vec{l}$:  
$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (d\vec{l} \times \hat{r})}{r^2}
$$
Consider a current element $I d\vec{l}$ along the z-axis at the origin, and calculate the field at a point $(r, 0, 0)$ on the x-axis. Here, $d\vec{l} = dl \hat{k}$ (along z), the position vector from the element to the point is $\vec{r} = r \hat{i}$, so $r = r$, $\hat{r} = \hat{i}$. Compute the cross product:  
$$
d\vec{l} \times \hat{r} = (dl \hat{k}) \times \hat{i} = dl (\hat{k} \times \hat{i}) = dl \hat{j}
$$
since $\hat{k} \times \hat{i} = \hat{j}$. The magnitude of the cross product is $|d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}| = dl \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $d\vec{l}$ and $\hat{r}$. Here, $\theta = 90^\circ$, so $\sin \theta = 1$. Substitute into the Biot-Savart law:  
$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (dl \hat{j})}{r^2} = \frac{\mu_0 I dl}{4 \pi r^2} \hat{j}
$$
The magnitude is:  
$$
dB = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{4 \pi r^2}
$$
In this case, $\sin \theta = 1$, but the general form holds for any angle $\theta$. For Problem 1, $I = 5 \, \text{A}$, $dl = 0.02 \, \text{m}$, $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$, $\theta = 90^\circ$, $dB = 1.00 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The field is perpendicular to both $d\vec{l}$ and $\vec{r}$ (right-hand rule); $\sin \theta$ accounts for orientation. Common error: Forgetting $\sin \theta$ or misinterpreting the angle.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$.

**Solution**:  
Consider a circular loop of radius $R$ in the xy-plane, centered at the origin, with current $I$ flowing counterclockwise (viewed from above). We need to find the magnetic field at the center $(0, 0, 0)$ using the Biot-Savart law: $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (d\vec{l} \times \hat{r})}{r^2}$.

Parameterize the loop: a point on the loop is $(R \cos \phi, R \sin \phi, 0)$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. The current element at angle $\phi$ is $d\vec{l} = R d\phi \hat{\phi}$, where $\hat{\phi} = (-\sin \phi \hat{i} + \cos \phi \hat{j})$. So, $d\vec{l} = R d\phi (-\sin \phi \hat{i} + \cos \phi \hat{j})$. The position vector from the element to the center is $\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0) - (R \cos \phi, R \sin \phi, 0) = (-R \cos \phi, -R \sin \phi, 0)$, $r = R$, $\hat{r} = (-\cos \phi, -\sin \phi, 0)$. Compute the cross product:  
$$
d\vec{l} \times \hat{r} = [R d\phi (-\sin \phi \hat{i} + \cos \phi \hat{j})] \times (-\cos \phi \hat{i} - \sin \phi \hat{j}) = R d\phi [(\sin \phi)(\sin \phi) + (\cos \phi)(\cos \phi)] \hat{k} = R d\phi \hat{k}
$$
Using the Biot-Savart law:  
$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (R d\phi \hat{k})}{R^2} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} d\phi \hat{k}
$$
Integrate over the loop from $\phi = 0$ to $2\pi$:  
$$
\vec{B} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} d\phi \hat{k} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} (2 \pi) \hat{k} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R} \hat{k}
$$
The magnitude is $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$, directed along the z-axis. For Problem 3, $R = 0.05 \, \text{m}$, $I = 3 \, \text{A}$, $B \approx 3.77 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Symmetry ensures only the z-component remains; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Forgetting to integrate over the entire loop.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96

- (c) $8.01 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $8.02 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
Using the Biot-Savart law, $dB = \frac{\mu_0 I dl \sin \theta}{4 \pi r^2}$. Given $I = 4 \, \text{A}$, $dl = 0.02 \, \text{m}$, $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$, $\theta = 90^\circ$, $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$:  
$$
dB = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 4 \times 0.02 \times 1}{4 \pi \times (0.1)^2} = \frac{4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 4 \times 0.02}{4 \pi \times 0.01} = 8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{T}
$$
The answer is (b) $8.00 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Small $dB$ requires integration for finite sources; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Forgetting to square $r$.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A circular loop with $R = 0.03 \, \text{m}$, $I = 2 \, \text{A}$ at its center. Calculate $B$.  
- (a) $4.18 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (b) $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (c) $4.20 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $4.21 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$. Given $R = 0.03 \, \text{m}$, $I = 2 \, \text{A}$, $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$:  
$$
B = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 2}{2 \times 0.03} = \frac{8 \pi \times 10^{-7}}{0.06} \approx 4.1888 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}
$$
Round to two decimal places: $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$. The answer is (b) $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Field at the center is stronger for smaller $R$; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Using the straight wire formula or incorrect $\mu_0$.
