# Kinetic Energy and Work Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of kinetic energy and work, including the definition of work, kinetic energy and the work-energy theorem, work done by variable forces (e.g., springs), and power in mechanical systems. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering energy concepts, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
