# Quarks, Leptons, and the Big Bang Solutions

This section provides **sample solutions** for selected problems from the Quarks, Leptons, and the Big Bang chapter, focusing on fundamental particles, their interactions, the Standard Model, and cosmological events like the Big Bang, with applications such as cosmic ray effects on spacecraft. These solutions are designed to help JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET students understand key concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each solution includes detailed steps, exam-focused tips to avoid common mistakes, and alignment with JEE/NEET exam patterns. Full solutions for all 100 problems will be available in June 2025.

## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: Calculate the electric charge of a proton (uud) in units of elementary charge. Given: up quark charge $q_u = +2/3$, down quark charge $q_d = -1/3$.  
- (a) +0.99  
- (b) +1.00  
- (c) +1.01  
- (d) +1.02

**Solution**:  
A proton’s quark composition is uud: two up quarks (u) and one down quark (d). Given the charges: $q_u = +2/3$, $q_d = -1/3$, in units of elementary charge ($e$).  
The total charge of the proton is the sum of the charges of its quarks:  
$$
\text{Charge} = 2 \times q_u + 1 \times q_d = 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 1 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 1
$$
The charge is exactly $+1.00$ in units of elementary charge, matching the proton’s known charge. The answer is (b) +1.00.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Sum the quark charges directly; the proton’s charge must be +1 to match experimental data. Common error: Misinterpreting quark charges or forgetting the number of quarks.

### Solution 2
**Problem**: A galaxy is at a distance of 20 Mpc from Earth. Using Hubble’s law with $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, calculate its recession velocity in km/s.  
- (a) 1347 km/s  
- (b) 1348 km/s  
- (c) 1349 km/s  
- (d) 1350 km/s

**Solution**:  
Hubble’s law relates a galaxy’s recession velocity $v$ to its distance $d$ from Earth:  
$$
v = H_0 d
$$
Given $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, $d = 20 \, \text{Mpc}$:  
$$
v = 67.4 \times 20 = 1348 \, \text{km/s}
$$
The answer is (b) 1348 km/s.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Ensure units are consistent (km/s/Mpc and Mpc give km/s); $H_0$ values may vary slightly (e.g., 67–73 km/s/Mpc), but use the given value. Common error: Unit mismatch or rounding too early.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What is the electric charge of an up quark?  
- (a) $+1/3$  
- (b) $+2/3$  
- (c) $-1/3$  
- (d) $-2/3$

**Solution**:  
In the Standard Model, quarks have fractional electric charges in units of the elementary charge ($e$). The up quark (u), along with charm and top quarks, is an up-type quark with a charge of $+2/3$. This distinguishes it from down-type quarks (down, strange, bottom), which have a charge of $-1/3$. The up quark’s charge is a fundamental property, experimentally verified through particle interactions (e.g., proton charge: uud = $+1$).  
- (a) Incorrect: $+1/3$ is the charge of an anti-down quark, not an up quark.  
- (b) Correct: The up quark has a charge of $+2/3$.  
- (c) Incorrect: $-1/3$ is the charge of a down quark.  
- (d) Incorrect: $-2/3$ is the charge of an anti-up quark.  
The answer is (b) $+2/3$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Memorize quark charges: up-type ($+2/3$), down-type ($-1/3$); antiparticles have opposite charges. Common error: Confusing up and down quark charges.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What is the unit of Hubble’s constant $H_0$ in the given form ($H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$)?  
- (a) km/s  
- (b) km/s/Mpc  
- (c) Mpc  
- (d) s$^{-1}$

**Solution**:  
Hubble’s law is $v = H_0 d$, where $v$ is the recession velocity (km/s), $d$ is the distance (Mpc), and $H_0$ is Hubble’s constant. Given $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, the unit of $H_0$ is determined by the equation:  
- $v$ has units of km/s, $d$ has units of Mpc.  
- Thus, $H_0 = \frac{v}{d}$ has units of $\text{km/s/Mpc}$.  
The unit km/s is velocity, Mpc is distance, and s$^{-1}$ is the unit of $H_0$ in a different form (when distances are in different units), but the given form specifies km/s/Mpc.  
- (a) Incorrect: km/s is the unit of velocity, not $H_0$.  
- (b) Correct: The given form of $H_0$ has units km/s/Mpc.  
- (c) Incorrect: Mpc is a unit of distance, not $H_0$.  
- (d) Incorrect: s$^{-1}$ is the unit of $H_0$ in a different context (e.g., when using SI units), but not in the given form.  
The answer is (b) km/s/Mpc.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Check the units in Hubble’s law; the given form dictates the answer. Common error: Assuming SI units (s$^{-1}$) without checking the problem’s form.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the electric charge of a proton (uud) using quark charges.

**Solution**:  
A proton consists of three quarks: two up quarks (u) and one down quark (d), denoted as uud. The charges of the quarks are given as:  
- Up quark: $q_u = +2/3$ (in units of elementary charge $e$).  
- Down quark: $q_d = -1/3$.  
The total electric charge of the proton is the sum of the charges of its constituent quarks:  
$$
\text{Charge of proton} = 2 \times q_u + 1 \times q_d
$$
Substitute the charges:  
$$
\text{Charge} = 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 1 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 1
$$
The proton’s charge is $+1$ in units of elementary charge, consistent with experimental observations. This matches Numerical Solution 1, where the charge is $+1.00$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Quark charges are fractional; sum them to match the particle’s known charge. Common error: Forgetting the number of quarks or using incorrect charges.

### Solution 52
**Problem**: Derive the recession velocity of a galaxy using Hubble’s law $v = H_0 d$.

**Solution**:  
Hubble’s law states that the recession velocity $v$ of a galaxy is proportional to its distance $d$ from the observer, with the Hubble constant $H_0$ as the proportionality factor:  
$$
v = H_0 d
$$
- $v$ is the recession velocity (in km/s).  
- $d$ is the distance to the galaxy (in Mpc).  
- $H_0$ is Hubble’s constant (in km/s/Mpc).  
The law arises from the expansion of the universe, where more distant galaxies recede faster due to the stretching of space itself, as evidenced by redshift observations. For a given $H_0$ and $d$, we compute $v$ directly.  
For Problem 2, $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, $d = 20 \, \text{Mpc}$:  
$$
v = 67.4 \times 20 = 1348 \, \text{km/s}
$$
This matches Numerical Solution 2.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Hubble’s law is linear; ensure units are consistent for $v$, $d$, and $H_0$. Common error: Misinterpreting $H_0$’s units or forgetting to multiply.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: Calculate the electric charge of a neutron (udd). Given: $q_u = +2/3$, $q_d = -1/3$.  
- (a) -0.01  
- (b) 0.00  
- (c) 0.01  
- (d) 0.02

**Solution**:  
A neutron’s quark composition is udd: one up quark (u) and two down quarks (d). Given the charges: $q_u = +2/3$, $q_d = -1/3$, in units of elementary charge ($e$).  
The total charge of the neutron is:  
$$
\text{Charge} = 1 \times q_u + 2 \times q_d = 1 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 2 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 0
$$
The charge is exactly 0.00, matching the neutron’s known neutrality. The answer is (b) 0.00.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Neutrons are neutral; quark charges must sum to zero. Common error: Miscounting quarks or flipping charges.

### Solution 97
**Problem**: A galaxy is at 25 Mpc. Using $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, calculate its recession velocity in km/s.  
- (a) 1684 km/s  
- (b) 1685 km/s  
- (c) 1686 km/s  
- (d) 1687 km/s

**Solution**:  
Using Hubble’s law:  
$$
v = H_0 d
$$
Given $H_0 = 67.4 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}$, $d = 25 \, \text{Mpc}$:  
$$
v = 67.4 \times 25 = 1685 \, \text{km/s}
$$
The answer is (b) 1685 km/s.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Hubble’s law gives velocity directly; multiply $H_0$ by $d$ and check units. Common error: Rounding incorrectly or using an incorrect $H_0$.
