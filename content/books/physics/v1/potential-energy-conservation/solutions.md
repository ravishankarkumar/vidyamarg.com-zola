## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A $3 \, kg$ block is lifted to $h = 4 \, m$ above the ground ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$). Calculate the gravitational potential energy relative to the ground.  
- (a) $100.0 \, J$  
- (b) $117.6 \, J$  
- (c) $135.2 \, J$  
- (d) $152.8 \, J$

**Solution**:  
Gravitational potential energy is given by $PE_g = mgh$, where $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height above the reference level. Here, $m = 3 \, kg$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$, and $h = 4 \, m$ (with the ground as the reference level, $h = 0$).  
$$
PE_g = mgh = 3 \times 9.8 \times 4 = 117.6 \, J
$$  
The answer is (b) $117.6 \, J$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Gravitational potential energy depends on the chosen reference level; here, the ground is specified as $h = 0$, so use the given height directly. Common error: Forgetting to multiply by $g$ or using an incorrect reference level.

### Solution 3
**Problem**: A $2 \, kg$ block is dropped from $h = 6 \, m$ above the ground ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$), with no air resistance. Calculate the speed just before hitting the ground.  
- (a) $9.0 \, m/s$  
- (b) $10.0 \, m/s$  
- (c) $11.0 \, m/s$  
- (d) $12.0 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
Since no air resistance acts, only the conservative gravitational force does work, so mechanical energy is conserved: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. At the initial position ($h = 6 \, m$), the block is at rest, so $v_i = 0$, $KE_i = 0$, $PE_i = mgh$, with $m = 2 \, kg$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$, $h = 6 \, m$:  
$$
PE_i = mgh = 2 \times 9.8 \times 6 = 117.6 \, J
$$  
At the ground ($h = 0$), $PE_f = 0$, $KE_f = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2$. Conservation of energy:  
$$
0 + 117.6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times v_f^2 + 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 117.6 = v_f^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_f = \sqrt{117.6} \approx 10.84 \, m/s
$$  
Rounding to 2 significant figures (since $h = 6$ has 1 significant figure, but $g = 9.8$ has 2, use 2, April 14, 2025), $v_f \approx 10.8 \, m/s$. The closest option is $11.0 \, m/s$, reflecting typical exam rounding adjustments.  
The answer is (c) $11.0 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: With only conservative forces, use conservation of mechanical energy; potential energy converts fully to kinetic energy here. Common error: Forgetting to take the square root to find speed.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What does gravitational potential energy depend on?  
- (a) Mass only  
- (b) Height only  
- (c) Mass, gravity, and height  
- (d) Mass and velocity

**Solution**:  
Gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface is given by $PE_g = mgh$, where $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately constant at $9.8 \, m/s^2$ near the surface), and $h$ is the height above a chosen reference level. This formula shows that gravitational potential energy depends on:  
- The mass of the object ($m$).  
- The acceleration due to gravity ($g$).  
- The height above the reference level ($h$).  
- (a) Incorrect: It’s not just mass; height and gravity also matter.  
- (b) Incorrect: Height alone isn’t enough; mass and gravity are required.  
- (c) Correct: Mass, gravity, and height all determine gravitational potential energy.  
- (d) Incorrect: Velocity affects kinetic energy, not gravitational potential energy.  
The answer is (c) Mass, gravity, and height.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Gravitational potential energy is a positional energy; ensure all factors ($m$, $g$, $h$) are considered, and choose the reference level consistently. Common error: Assuming velocity affects potential energy, which is a misconception.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What does conservation of mechanical energy imply?  
- (a) Kinetic energy is constant  
- (b) Potential energy is constant  
- (c) Total mechanical energy is constant with only conservative forces  
- (d) Total mechanical energy is constant regardless of forces

**Solution**:  
Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy ($KE$) and potential energy ($PE$): $E_{\text{mech}} = KE + PE$. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if only conservative forces (e.g., gravity, spring force) do work, the total mechanical energy remains constant: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. This holds because conservative forces’ work depends only on position, not the path, and is related to potential energy changes ($W_{\text{cons}} = -\Delta PE$). If non-conservative forces (e.g., friction) act, mechanical energy is not conserved, as energy may be dissipated (e.g., as heat).  
- (a) Incorrect: Kinetic energy changes as potential energy changes (e.g., a falling object).  
- (b) Incorrect: Potential energy changes as kinetic energy changes (e.g., a spring oscillating).  
- (c) Correct: Total mechanical energy is constant when only conservative forces act.  
- (d) Incorrect: Non-conservative forces cause energy loss, so mechanical energy isn’t conserved.  
The answer is (c) Total mechanical energy is constant with only conservative forces.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Conservation applies only when non-conservative forces do no work; check for forces like friction or air resistance. Common error: Assuming conservation holds with friction present.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the gravitational potential energy near Earth’s surface.

**Solution**:  
Gravitational potential energy represents the work done to move an object to a height in a gravitational field. Near Earth’s surface, gravity is approximately constant, $\vec{F}_g = -mg \hatT -1 \hat{j}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.8 \, m/s^2$). To derive the potential energy, consider lifting a mass $m$ from a reference level (where $h = 0$) to a height $h$ above that level. The external force required to lift the mass against gravity must balance the gravitational force, so $\vec{F}_{\text{ext}} = mg \hat{j}$ (upward, opposite to gravity). The displacement is $\vec{d} = h \hat{j}$ (vertical upward). The work done by the external force to lift the mass is:  
$$
W_{\text{ext}} = \vec{F}_{\text{ext}} \cdot \vec{d} = (mg \hat{j}) \cdot (h \hat{j}) = mgh
$$  
This work becomes the gravitational potential energy at height $h$, as it’s the energy stored due to the object’s position:  
$$
PE_g = mgh
$$  
The work done by gravity itself is $W_g = -mgh$, confirming that $W_g = -\Delta PE_g = -(PE_f - PE_i)$, where $PE_f = mgh$ and $PE_i = 0$ (at the reference level). For example, if $m = 3 \, kg$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$, $h = 4 \, m$ (as in Problem 1), $PE_g = 3 \times 9.8 \times 4 = 117.6 \, J$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Gravitational potential energy is the work done against gravity to reach a height; the reference level ($h = 0$) is arbitrary but must be consistent. Common error: Forgetting the negative sign in $W_g = -\Delta PE_g$ when considering the work done by gravity.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the conservation of mechanical energy for gravity.

**Solution**:  
Conservation of mechanical energy states that if only conservative forces do work, the total mechanical energy ($E_{\text{mech}} = KE + PE$) remains constant: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. For gravity (a conservative force), consider a mass $m$ moving under gravity near Earth’s surface, $\vec{F}_g = -mg \hat{j}$. The work done by a conservative force equals the negative change in potential energy: $W_{\text{cons}} = -\Delta PE$. For gravity, $PE = mgh$, so if the mass moves from height $h_i$ to $h_f$, $\Delta PE = PE_f - PE_i = mgh_f - mgh_i$, and:  
$$
W_g = -(mgh_f - mgh_i)
$$  
The work-energy theorem states that the total work done equals the change in kinetic energy: $W_{\text{total}} = \Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i$. If only gravity acts, $W_{\text{total}} = W_g$:  
$$
W_g = \Delta KE \quad \Rightarrow \quad -(mgh_f - mgh_i) = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 - \frac{1}{2} m v_i^2
$$  
Rearrange:  
$$
\frac{1}{2} m v_i^2 + mgh_i = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2 + mgh_f \quad \Rightarrow \quad KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f
$$  
This shows mechanical energy is conserved. For example, in Problem 3, a $2 \, kg$ block dropped from $h = 6 \, m$ has $KE_i + PE_i = 0 + 117.6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times v_f^2 + 0$, confirming $v_f \approx 10.84 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Conservation holds when only conservative forces act; use initial and final energies to solve for unknowns like speed. Common error: Including non-conservative forces (e.g., friction) without adjusting for energy loss.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A $2 \, kg$ block is dropped from $h = 5 \, m$ above the ground ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$), with no air resistance. What is the speed just before hitting the ground?  
- (a) $8.0 \, m/s$  
- (b) $9.0 \, m/s$  
- (c) $10.0 \, m/s$  
- (d) $11.0 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
With no air resistance, mechanical energy is conserved: $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. Initially, at $h = 5 \, m$, $v_i = 0$, $KE_i = 0$, $PE_i = mgh = 2 \times 9.8 \times 5 = 98 \, J$. At the ground, $h = 0$, $PE_f = 0$, $KE_f = \frac{1}{2} m v_f^2$:  
$$
0 + 98 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times v_f^2 + 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 98 = v_f^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_f = \sqrt{98} \approx 9.90 \, m/s
$$  
Round to $9.9 \, m/s$, closest to $10.0 \, m/s$.  
The answer is (c) $10.0 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: No air resistance means gravity is the only force; use conservation to find speed directly. Common error: Forgetting to square root the final result.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A $1 \, kg$ block slides down a frictionless incline from $h = 3 \, m$ into a spring ($k = 100 \, N/m$) ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$). What is the maximum compression of the spring?  
- (a) $0.4 \, m$  
- (b) $0.5 \, m$  
- (c) $0.6 \, m$  
- (d) $0.7 \, m$

**Solution**:  
Mechanical energy is conserved (frictionless incline): $KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$. At $h = 3 \, m$, $v_i = 0$, $KE_i = 0$, $PE_i = mgh = 1 \times 9.8 \times 3 = 29.4 \, J$. At maximum compression $x$, the block stops ($v_f = 0$), $KE_f = 0$, gravitational $PE_f = 0$ (at the bottom), spring $PE_{\text{spring}, f} = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$:  
$$
0 + 29.4 = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times x^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 29.4 = 50 x^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \frac{29.4}{50} = 0.588 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x \approx 0.767 \, m
$$  
Round to $0.8 \, m$, closest to $0.7 \, m$ (likely an exam rounding adjustment).  
The answer is (d) $0.7 \, m$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: At maximum compression, all mechanical energy converts to spring potential energy; solve for $x$. Common error: Forgetting to square $x$ in the spring energy term.
