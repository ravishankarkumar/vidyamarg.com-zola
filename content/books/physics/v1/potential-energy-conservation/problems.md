# Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of potential energy and conservation of energy, including gravitational and elastic potential energy, conservative and non-conservative forces, conservation of mechanical energy, and applications in gravitational systems, springs, and energy transformations. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering energy conservation, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
