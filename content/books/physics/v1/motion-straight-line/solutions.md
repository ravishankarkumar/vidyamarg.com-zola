# Motion Along a Straight Line Solutions

This section provides **sample solutions** for selected problems from the Motion Along a Straight Line chapter, focusing on displacement, velocity, acceleration, kinematic equations, and free fall. These solutions are designed to help JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET students understand key concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each solution includes detailed steps, exam-focused tips to avoid common mistakes, and alignment with JEE/NEET exam patterns. Full solutions for all 100 problems will be available in June 2025.

## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A car travels 200 m in 10 s with constant velocity. Calculate the velocity.  
- (a) $15 \, m/s$  
- (b) $20 \, m/s$  
- (c) $25 \, m/s$  
- (d) $30 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
For constant velocity, $v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$. Given $\Delta x = 200 \, m$, $\Delta t = 10 \, s$:  
$$
v = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \, m/s
$$  
The answer is (b) $20 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Ensure velocity is constant before using $v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$. Common error: Confusing displacement with distance when direction changes.

### Solution 3
**Problem**: A car starts from rest and accelerates at $3 \, m/s^2$ for 6 s. Calculate the final velocity.  
- (a) $15 \, m/s$  
- (b) $18 \, m/s$  
- (c) $21 \, m/s$  
- (d) $24 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
Use the kinematic equation $v = u + at$. Given $u = 0$ (starts from rest), $a = 3 \, m/s^2$, $t = 6 \, s$:  
$$
v = 0 + 3 \times 6 = 18 \, m/s
$$  
The answer is (b) $18 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Identify knowns and choose the right kinematic equation. Common error: Forgetting initial velocity is zero (April 14, 2025).

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What is the difference between displacement and distance?  
- (a) Displacement is a scalar, distance is a vector  
- (b) Displacement is a vector, distance is a scalar  
- (c) Both are scalars  
- (d) Both are vectors

**Solution**:  
Displacement is the shortest path between initial and final positions, a vector quantity with magnitude and direction (e.g., $5 \, m$ east). Distance is the total path length traveled, a scalar quantity with only magnitude (e.g., $5 \, m$).  
- (a) Incorrect: Displacement is a vector, not a scalar.  
- (b) Correct: Displacement is a vector, distance is a scalar.  
- (c) Incorrect: Displacement is a vector.  
- (d) Incorrect: Distance is a scalar.  
The answer is (b) Displacement is a vector, distance is a scalar.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Remember displacement depends on direction, while distance does not. Common error: Confusing scalar and vector quantities.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: Which kinematic equation relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement without time?  
- (a) $v = u + at$  
- (b) $x = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2$  
- (c) $v^2 = u^2 + 2ax$  
- (d) $x = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t$

**Solution**:  
The kinematic equations for constant acceleration are:  
- $v = u + at$ (involves time $t$).  
- $x = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2$ (involves time $t$).  
- $v^2 = u^2 + 2ax$ (no time $t$, relates velocity $v$, initial velocity $u$, acceleration $a$, displacement $x$).  
- $x = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t$ (involves time $t$).  
The answer is (c) $v^2 = u^2 + 2ax$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Identify the variable missing (here, time) to select the correct equation. Common error: Choosing an equation with time.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the kinematic equation $v = u + at$ using the definition of acceleration.

**Solution**:  
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity: $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$. For constant acceleration, $a$ is constant. Integrate both sides:  
$$
\int_{u}^{v} dv = \int_{0}^{t} a \, dt
$$  
Left side: $\int_{u}^{v} dv = v - u$. Right side: $\int_{0}^{t} a \, dt = at$ (since $a$ is constant). Thus:  
$$
v - u = at \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = u + at
$$  
This is the first kinematic equation.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use the definition of acceleration as a starting point for derivations. Common error: Assuming non-constant acceleration.

### Solution 52
**Problem**: Derive the kinematic equation $x = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2$ by integrating velocity.

**Solution**:  
From the first kinematic equation, velocity is $v = u + at$. Displacement is the integral of velocity over time: $x = \int_{0}^{t} v \, dt$. Substitute $v = u + at$:  
$$
x = \int_{0}^{t} (u + at) \, dt
$$  
Integrate: $\int_{0}^{t} (u + at) \, dt = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \Big|_{0}^{t} = (ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2) - (0 + 0)$. Thus:  
$$
x = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2
$$  
This is the second kinematic equation, assuming initial position $x_0 = 0$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Integrate velocity to find displacement; ensure initial conditions are clear. Common error: Forgetting the $\frac{1}{2}$ factor.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A car starts from rest and accelerates at $2 \, m/s^2$ for 5 s. What is the final velocity?  
- (a) $8 \, m/s$  
- (b) $10 \, m/s$  
- (c) $12 \, m/s$  
- (d) $14 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
Use the kinematic equation $v = u + at$. Given $u = 0$ (starts from rest), $a = 2 \, m/s^2$, $t = 5 \, s$:  
$$
v = 0 + 2 \times 5 = 10 \, m/s
$$  
The answer is (b) $10 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Check initial conditions (here, $u = 0$). Common error: Using the wrong kinematic equation.

### Solution 99
**Problem**: A ball is thrown upward with $u = 15 \, m/s$ ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$). What is the maximum height reached?  
- (a) $10 \, m$  
- (b) $11 \, m$  
- (c) $12 \, m$  
- (d) $13 \, m$

**Solution**:  
At maximum height, $v = 0$. Use $v^2 = u^2 + 2ax$, with $u = 15 \, m/s$, $v = 0$, $a = -g = -9.8 \, m/s^2$, $x = h$ (height):  
$$
0 = (15)^2 + 2(-9.8)h \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 = 225 - 19.6h \quad \Rightarrow \quad 19.6h = 225 \quad \Rightarrow \quad h = \frac{225}{19.6} \approx 11.48 \, m
$$  
Round to 2 significant figures: $11 \, m$.  
The answer is (b) $11 \, m$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Set final velocity to zero at maximum height; use $g$ as negative for upward motion. Common error: Using positive $g$ (April 14, 2025).
