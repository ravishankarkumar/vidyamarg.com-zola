# Images Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of image formation through geometric optics, including calculations of image distance, magnification, and focal length for mirrors and lenses, as well as the principles of optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering ray optics, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
