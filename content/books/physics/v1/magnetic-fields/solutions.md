## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A wire carries a current $I = 5 \, \text{A}$ and has length $L = 0.2 \, \text{m}$ in a magnetic field $B = 0.3 \, \text{T}$ (perpendicular to the wire). Calculate the force on the wire.  
- (a) $0.299 \, \text{N}$  
- (b) $0.300 \, \text{N}$  
- (c) $0.301 \, \text{N}$  
- (d) $0.302 \, \text{N}$

**Solution**:  
The force on a current-carrying wire in a uniform magnetic field is given by $F = I L B \sin \theta$, where $I$ is the current, $L$ is the length of the wire, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $\theta$ is the angle between the wire and the magnetic field. Given $I = 5 \, \text{A}$, $L = 0.2 \, \text{m}$, $B = 0.3 \, \text{T}$, and $\theta = 90^\circ$ (since the field is perpendicular to the wire):  
$$
F = I L B \sin \theta = 5 \times 0.2 \times 0.3 \times \sin 90^\circ = 5 \times 0.2 \times 0.3 \times 1 = 0.3 \, \text{N}
$$
The answer is (b) $0.300 \, \text{N}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Ensure $\theta$ is the angle between the wire and the field; $\sin 90^\circ = 1$ maximizes the force. Common error: Forgetting $\sin \theta$ or using the wrong angle.

### Solution 3
**Problem**: An infinite straight wire carries $I = 10 \, \text{A}$. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance $r = 0.05 \, \text{m}$ using the Biot-Savart law ($\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$).  
- (a) $3.99 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (b) $4.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (c) $4.01 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $4.02 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
For an infinite straight wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance $r$ can be derived using the Biot-Savart law, but the standard result is $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$, where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $I$ is the current, and $r$ is the distance from the wire. Given $I = 10 \, \text{A}$, $r = 0.05 \, \text{m}$, and $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$:  
$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r} = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 10}{2 \pi \times 0.05} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{0.1} = 4 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}
$$
The answer is (b) $4.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The field decreases as $1/r$; ensure $r$ is in meters and use $\mu_0$ correctly. Common error: Using the incorrect formula, such as for a loop or solenoid.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What is the unit of magnetic field in SI units?  
- (a) Tesla  
- (b) Ampere  
- (c) Ohm  
- (d) Volt

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field $\vec{B}$ exerts a force on a moving charge, given by $\vec{F} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$. The SI unit of magnetic field is derived from this equation: $F = q v B \sin \theta$. Rearrange for $B$: $B = \frac{F}{q v \sin \theta}$. The unit of force $F$ is newton (N), charge $q$ is coulomb (C), and velocity $v$ is meters per second (m/s). Since $F$ has units $\text{N}$, $q$ has units $\text{C}$, and $v$ has units $\text{m/s}$, the unit of $B$ is:  
$$
\text{Unit of } B = \frac{\text{N}}{\text{C} \cdot \text{m/s}}
$$
Since $1 \, \text{C} = 1 \, \text{A·s}$ (ampere-second), $\text{N}/(\text{C} \cdot \text{m/s}) = \text{N}/(\text{A·s} \cdot \text{m/s}) = \text{N}/(\text{A·m})$. This unit is defined as a tesla (T), so $1 \, \text{T} = 1 \, \text{N/(A·m)}$. Ampere is the unit of current, ohm is the unit of resistance, and volt is the unit of electric potential, none of which match the unit of magnetic field.  
- (a) Correct: The unit of magnetic field is tesla (T).  
- (b) Incorrect: Ampere (A) is the unit of current, not magnetic field.  
- (c) Incorrect: Ohm ($\Omega$) is the unit of resistance, not magnetic field.  
- (d) Incorrect: Volt (V) is the unit of electric potential, not magnetic field.  
The answer is (a) Tesla.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Magnetic field units are tesla; distinguish from electric field (N/C or V/m). Common error: Confusing tesla with other units like ampere or volt.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What is the relationship between magnetic field and distance from an infinite straight wire?  
- (a) $B \propto r$  
- (b) $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$  
- (c) $B \propto r^2$  
- (d) $B \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field due to an infinite straight wire carrying current $I$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ is given by the Biot-Savart law or Ampere’s law as $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$, where $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. This formula shows that the magnetic field $B$ is inversely proportional to the distance $r$ from the wire: $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$. The field forms circular loops around the wire, and its magnitude decreases as you move farther away, consistent with the $1/r$ dependence. A linear dependence ($B \propto r$) would imply the field increases with distance, which is incorrect. A $1/r^2$ dependence is typical for point sources (like electric fields from a point charge), not an infinite wire, and $r^2$ dependence is not applicable here.  
- (a) Incorrect: $B \propto r$ would mean the field increases with distance, which is not true.  
- (b) Correct: $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$, as per the formula for an infinite wire.  
- (c) Incorrect: $B \propto r^2$ would imply the field increases quadratically, which is incorrect.  
- (d) Incorrect: $B \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$ applies to point sources, not an infinite wire.  
The answer is (b) $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The $1/r$ dependence is unique to infinite straight wires; compare with $1/r^2$ for point sources. Common error: Confusing with electric field dependence ($1/r^2$ for a point charge).

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire in a uniform magnetic field $F = I L B \sin \theta$.

**Solution**:  
Consider a straight wire of length $L$ carrying current $I$ in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The current consists of charges $q$ moving with drift velocity $\vec{v}$ along the wire. We can derive the force using the Lorentz force on individual charges and then relate it to the current.

The wire’s length vector $\vec{L}$ is in the direction of the current $I$. Assume $N$ charges, each with charge $q$, move through the wire. The drift velocity $\vec{v}$ is along the wire, and in a time $\Delta t$, each charge moves a distance $v \Delta t$. The total length of the wire $L = v \Delta t$ (if all charges move the length of the wire in time $\Delta t$). The current $I$ is the rate of charge flow: $I = \frac{N q}{\Delta t}$, so $N q = I \Delta t$. The force on one charge is $\vec{F}_{\text{charge}} = q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$. Since $\vec{v}$ is along the wire, the total length moved by all charges corresponds to $\vec{L}$, so $\vec{v} \Delta t = \vec{L}$, or $\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{L}}{\Delta t}$. The total force on all $N$ charges is:  
$$
\vec{F} = N \vec{F}_{\text{charge}} = N q (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = (N q) \left( \frac{\vec{L}}{\Delta t} \times \vec{B} \right) = (I \Delta t) \left( \frac{\vec{L}}{\Delta t} \times \vec{B} \right) = I (\vec{L} \times \vec{B})
$$
The magnitude is $F = I L B \sin \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{L}$ and $\vec{B}$. This matches the given expression. For Problem 1, $I = 5 \, \text{A}$, $L = 0.2 \, \text{m}$, $B = 0.3 \, \text{T}$, $\theta = 90^\circ$, $F = 0.300 \, \text{N}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use the right-hand rule to determine the force direction; $\sin \theta$ accounts for orientation. Common error: Forgetting $\sin \theta$ or misinterpreting the angle.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$.

**Solution**:  
Consider a circular loop of radius $R$ lying in the xy-plane, centered at the origin, with current $I$ flowing in the counterclockwise direction (viewed from above). We need to find the magnetic field at the center of the loop $(0, 0, 0)$ using the Biot-Savart law: $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (d\vec{l} \times \hat{r})}{r^2}$.

Parameterize the loop: a point on the loop is $(R \cos \phi, R \sin \phi, 0)$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. The current element $d\vec{l}$ at angle $\phi$ has length $R d\phi$ in the tangential direction $\hat{\phi} = (-\sin \phi, \cos \phi, 0)$, so $d\vec{l} = R d\phi \hat{\phi} = R d\phi (-\sin \phi \hat{i} + \cos \phi \hat{j})$. The position of the element is $\vec{r}' = (R \cos \phi, R \sin \phi, 0)$, and the field point is the center $(0, 0, 0)$, so $\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0) - (R \cos \phi, R \sin \phi, 0) = (-R \cos \phi, -R \sin \phi, 0)$, $r = R$, $\hat{r} = \frac{\vec{r}}{r} = (-\cos \phi, -\sin \phi, 0)$. Compute the cross product:  
$$
d\vec{l} \times \hat{r} = (R d\phi (-\sin \phi \hat{i} + \cos \phi \hat{j})) \times (-\cos \phi \hat{i} - \sin \phi \hat{j}) = R d\phi [(\sin \phi)(\sin \phi) + (\cos \phi)(\cos \phi)] \hat{k} = R d\phi \hat{k}
$$
Using the Biot-Savart law:  
$$
d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{I (R d\phi \hat{k})}{R^2} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} d\phi \hat{k}
$$
Integrate over the loop from $\phi = 0$ to $2\pi$:  
$$
\vec{B} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} d\phi \hat{k} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4 \pi R} (2 \pi) \hat{k} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R} \hat{k}
$$
The magnitude is $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$, directed along the z-axis (perpendicular to the loop plane). For Problem 4, $R = 0.1 \, \text{m}$, $I = 2 \, \text{A}$, $B \approx 1.257 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Symmetry ensures only the z-component remains; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Forgetting to integrate over the entire loop.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A wire with $I = 3 \, \text{A}$, $L = 0.25 \, \text{m}$ in $B = 0.2 \, \text{T}$ (perpendicular). Calculate the force.  
- (a) $0.149 \, \text{N}$  
- (b) $0.150 \, \text{N}$  
- (c) $0.151 \, \text{N}$  
- (d) $0.152 \, \text{N}$

**Solution**:  
The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is $F = I L B \sin \theta$. Given $I = 3 \, \text{A}$, $L = 0.25 \, \text{m}$, $B = 0.2 \, \text{T}$, and $\theta = 90^\circ$:  
$$
F = 3 \times 0.25 \times 0.2 \times \sin 90^\circ = 3 \times 0.25 \times 0.2 \times 1 = 0.150 \, \text{N}
$$
The answer is (b) $0.150 \, \text{N}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Force is maximum when perpendicular; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Using the wrong angle or forgetting $\sin \theta$.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A loop with $R = 0.03 \, \text{m}$, $I = 2 \, \text{A}$ at its center. Calculate $B$.  
- (a) $4.18 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (b) $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (c) $4.20 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$  
- (d) $4.21 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$

**Solution**:  
The magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 R}$. Given $R = 0.03 \, \text{m}$, $I = 2 \, \text{A}$, $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A}$:  
$$
B = \frac{(4 \pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 2}{2 \times 0.03} = \frac{8 \pi \times 10^{-7}}{0.06} \approx 4.1888 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}
$$
Round to two decimal places: $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$. The answer is (b) $4.19 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Field at the center is stronger for smaller $R$; use the right-hand rule for direction. Common error: Using the straight wire formula or incorrect $\mu_0$.
