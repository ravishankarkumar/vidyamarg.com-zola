# Center of Mass and Linear Momentum Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of center of mass and linear momentum, including the definition and calculation of the center of mass, linear momentum and its conservation, impulse and its relation to momentum change, and collisions (elastic and inelastic) with applications. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges.
