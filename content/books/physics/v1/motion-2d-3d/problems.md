# Motion in Two and Three Dimensions Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of motion in two and three dimensions, including position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, projectile motion, uniform circular motion, and relative motion. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering multi-dimensional motion, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
