## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A particle moves from position $\vec{r}_1 = 2 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} \, m$ to $\vec{r}_2 = 6 \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j} \, m$ in $4 \, s$. Calculate the magnitude of the average velocity.  
- (a) $1.25 \, m/s$  
- (b) $2.5 \, m/s$  
- (c) $3.75 \, m/s$  
- (d) $5.0 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
The average velocity in 2D motion is a vector quantity defined as $\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec{\Delta r}}{\Delta t}$, where $\vec{\Delta r}$ is the displacement. First, calculate the displacement:  
$$
\vec{\Delta r} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1 = (6 \hat{i} + 8 \hat{j}) - (2 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j}) = (6 - 2) \hat{i} + (8 - 3) \hat{j} = 4 \hat{i} + 5 \hat{j} \, m
$$  
Given $\Delta t = 4 \, s$, the average velocity is:  
$$
\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{4 \hat{i} + 5 \hat{j}}{4} = 1 \hat{i} + 1.25 \hat{j} \, m/s
$$  
Magnitude of the average velocity:  
$$
|\vec{v}_{\text{avg}}| = \sqrt{(1)^2 + (1.25)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1.5625} = \sqrt{2.5625} \approx 1.60 \, m/s
$$  
Among the options, the closest value, considering 2 significant figures (April 14, 2025), is $1.25 \, m/s$.  
The answer is (a) $1.25 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Displacement is the vector difference between final and initial positions; divide by time to get average velocity, then compute the magnitude. Common error: Using distance instead of displacement, which ignores direction.

### Solution 4
**Problem**: A projectile is launched at $v_0 = 40 \, m/s$ at $\theta = 30^\circ$ ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$). Calculate the time of flight.  
- (a) $2.0 \, s$  
- (b) $3.0 \, s$  
- (c) $4.0 \, s$  
- (d) $5.0 \, s$

**Solution**:  
The time of flight $T$ for a projectile on level ground is the total time it takes to return to $y = 0$. The formula is:  
$$
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$  
Given $v_0 = 40 \, m/s$, $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin 30^\circ = 0.5$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$:  
$$
T = \frac{2 \times 40 \times 0.5}{9.8} = \frac{40}{9.8} \approx 4.08 \, s
$$  
Rounding to 2 significant figures (since $v_0 = 40$ has 2 significant figures, April 14, 2025), $T \approx 4.1 \, s$. Among the options, the closest is $4.0 \, s$.  
The answer is (c) $4.0 \, s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use the time of flight formula directly; ensure $\theta$ is in the correct trigonometric function ($\sin \theta$). Common error: Using $\cos \theta$ or forgetting the factor of 2.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What is the main difference between motion in 1D and 2D?  
- (a) 1D involves scalars, 2D involves vectors  
- (b) 1D involves vectors, 2D involves scalars  
- (c) 1D has one component, 2D has two components  
- (d) 1D has two components, 2D has one component

**Solution**:  
In 1D motion, quantities like position, velocity, and acceleration are along a single axis (e.g., x-axis), requiring only one component (e.g., $x$, $v_x$, $a_x$), though they can still be vectors with direction (positive or negative). In 2D motion, these quantities are in a plane, requiring two components (e.g., $\vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j}$, $\vec{v} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j}$).  
- (a) Incorrect: Both 1D and 2D involve vectors, but 1D vectors have only one component.  
- (b) Incorrect: 2D motion involves vectors, not scalars.  
- (c) Correct: 1D motion has one component, 2D has two components.  
- (d) Incorrect: 1D has one component, 2D has two.  
The answer is (c) 1D has one component, 2D has two components.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Recognize that 2D motion requires vector components in two directions; 1D simplifies to a single axis. Common error: Assuming 1D motion cannot involve vectors (e.g., velocity in 1D can be negative).

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What is the direction of centripetal acceleration in uniform circular motion?  
- (a) Tangent to the circle  
- (b) Away from the center  
- (c) Toward the center  
- (d) Along the velocity

**Solution**:  
In uniform circular motion, the speed is constant, but the velocity vector changes direction continuously, pointing tangent to the circle. This change in direction requires an acceleration, called centripetal acceleration, which always points toward the center of the circle to keep the object on its circular path. The formula is $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$, and its direction is radially inward.  
- (a) Incorrect: Velocity is tangent, not acceleration.  
- (b) Incorrect: Acceleration is inward, not outward (outward would be centrifugal, a pseudo-force in non-inertial frames).  
- (c) Correct: Centripetal acceleration points toward the center.  
- (d) Incorrect: Velocity is tangent, acceleration is perpendicular to velocity.  
The answer is (c) Toward the center.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Centripetal acceleration is always inward; distinguish it from velocity (tangent) and centrifugal effects (non-inertial frames). Common error: Confusing with velocity direction.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the expression for instantaneous velocity in 3D motion using the position vector.

**Solution**:  
In 3D motion, the position vector of a particle relative to an origin is $\vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j} + z(t) \hat{k}$, where $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ are the coordinates as functions of time $t$. The instantaneous velocity $\vec{v}$ is the rate of change of position with respect to time, defined as the derivative:  
$$
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
$$  
Differentiate each component of the position vector:  
$$
\vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j} + z(t) \hat{k}
$$  
$$
\vec{v} = \frac{d}{dt} (x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j} + z(t) \hat{k}) = \frac{dx}{dt} \hat{i} + \frac{dy}{dt} \hat{j} + \frac{dz}{dt} \hat{k} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} + v_z \hat{k}
$$  
Where $v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}$, $v_y = \frac{dy}{dt}$, $v_z = \frac{dz}{dt}$ are the velocity components. For example, if $\vec{r}(t) = (2t) \hat{i} + (3t^2) \hat{j} + (t) \hat{k}$, then $\vec{v} = 2 \hat{i} + (6t) \hat{j} + 1 \hat{k}$. In 2D, the $z$-component is zero.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Differentiate each component of the position vector separately to find velocity; ensure all dimensions are considered in 3D. Common error: Forgetting to differentiate or omitting components.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the time of flight for a projectile launched at an angle on level ground.

**Solution**:  
A projectile is launched with initial velocity $v_0$ at angle $\theta$ above the horizontal on level ground ($y = 0$). The motion is 2D: horizontal ($x$-axis, no acceleration) and vertical ($y$-axis, acceleration $a_y = -g$). The vertical position is given by:  
$$
y = (v_0 \sin \theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$  
The projectile returns to the ground when $y = 0$ (excluding the launch point at $t = 0$). Set $y = 0$:  
$$
(v_0 \sin \theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0
$$  
Factor out $t$:  
$$
t \left( v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t \right) = 0
$$  
Solutions are $t = 0$ (launch) or $v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t = 0$. Solve the second equation:  
$$
v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{2} g t = v_0 \sin \theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$  
This $t$ is the time of flight $T$, the total time the projectile is in the air. For example, if $v_0 = 40 \, m/s$, $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin 30^\circ = 0.5$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$, then $T = \frac{2 \times 40 \times 0.5}{9.8} \approx 4.08 \, s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The time of flight depends on the vertical component ($v_0 \sin \theta$); the factor of 2 accounts for the ascent and descent. Common error: Forgetting the factor of 2 or using $\cos \theta$.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A projectile is launched at $v_0 = 65 \, m/s$ at $\theta = 45^\circ$ ($g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$). What is the time of flight?  
- (a) $6.0 \, s$  
- (b) $7.0 \, s$  
- (c) $8.0 \, s$  
- (d) $9.0 \, s$

**Solution**:  
The time of flight for a projectile on level ground is:  
$$
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$  
Given $v_0 = 65 \, m/s$, $\theta = 45^\circ$, $\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707$, $g = 9.8 \, m/s^2$:  
$$
T = \frac{2 \times 65 \times 0.707}{9.8} = \frac{130 \times 0.707}{9.8} \approx \frac{91.91}{9.8} \approx 9.38 \, s
$$  
Rounding to 2 significant figures (since $v_0 = 65$ has 2 significant figures, April 14, 2025), $T \approx 9.4 \, s$. Among the options, the closest is $9.0 \, s$.  
The answer is (d) $9.0 \, s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use the vertical component to find time of flight; round answers according to significant figures. Common error: Using incorrect trigonometric values for $\theta$.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A boat moves at $\vec{v}_b = 10 \hat{i} \, m/s$ in a river with current $\vec{v}_r = 6 \hat{j} \, m/s$. What is the magnitude of the boat’s velocity relative to the ground?  
- (a) $11.66 \, m/s$  
- (b) $12 \, m/s$  
- (c) $13 \, m/s$  
- (d) $14 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
The boat’s velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water and the river’s current: $\vec{v}_{b/g} = \vec{v}_b + \vec{v}_r$. Given $\vec{v}_b = 10 \hat{i} \, m/s$, $\vec{v}_r = 6 \hat{j} \, m/s$:  
$$
\vec{v}_{b/g} = 10 \hat{i} + 6 \hat{j} \, m/s
$$  
Magnitude:  
$$
|\vec{v}_{b/g}| = \sqrt{(10)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 36} = \sqrt{136} \approx 11.66 \, m/s
$$  
The answer is (a) $11.66 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Add velocity vectors component-wise in relative motion problems; the magnitude gives the net speed. Common error: Adding magnitudes directly ($10 + 6 = 16$, which is incorrect).
