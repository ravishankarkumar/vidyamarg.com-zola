# Measurement Solutions

This section provides **sample solutions** for selected problems from the Measurement chapter, focusing on SI units, dimensional analysis, significant figures, and error analysis. These solutions are designed to help JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET students understand key concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each solution includes detailed steps, exam-focused tips to avoid common mistakes, and alignment with JEE/NEET exam patterns. Full solutions for all 100 problems will be available in June 2025.

## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: Convert a speed of $108 \, km/h$ to $m/s$.  
- (a) $25 \, m/s$  
- (b) $30 \, m/s$  
- (c) $35 \, m/s$  
- (d) $40 \, m/s$

**Solution**:  
To convert $km/h$ to $m/s$, use the conversion factor $\frac{1000 \, m}{3600 \, s} = \frac{5}{18}$.  
$$
108 \times \frac{5}{18} = \frac{108 \times 5}{18} = \frac{540}{18} = 30 \, m/s
$$  
The answer is (b) $30 \, m/s$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Memorize the conversion factor $\frac{5}{18}$ for $km/h$ to $m/s$. Common error: Using incorrect factors like $\frac{18}{5}$.

### Solution 2
**Problem**: A mass of $3.6 \, kg$ experiences an acceleration of $2.45 \, m/s^2$. Calculate the force in newtons with correct significant figures.  
- (a) $8.8 \, N$  
- (b) $8.82 \, N$  
- (c) $9.0 \, N$  
- (d) $9.2 \, N$

**Solution**:  
Force is given by $F = m a$. Given $m = 3.6 \, kg$, $a = 2.45 \, m/s^2$:  
$$
F = 3.6 \times 2.45 = 8.82 \, N
$$  
Significant figures: $3.6$ has 2, $2.45$ has 3. Use the least (2): $8.8 \, N$.  
The answer is (a) $8.8 \, N$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: In multiplication, use the least number of significant figures. Common error: Reporting $8.82 \, N$ without rounding (April 14, 2025).

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: Which of the following is a base SI unit?  
- (a) Newton  
- (b) Joule  
- (c) Meter  
- (d) Watt

**Solution**:  
Base SI units are fundamental, including meter ($m$), kilogram ($kg$), second ($s$), ampere ($A$), kelvin ($K$), mole ($mol$), and candela ($cd$).  
- Newton ($N = kg \cdot m / s^2$) is derived.  
- Joule ($J = kg \cdot m^2 / s^2$) is derived.  
- Meter ($m$) is a base unit.  
- Watt ($W = J/s$) is derived.  
The answer is (c) Meter.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Memorize the 7 base SI units. Common error: Confusing derived units like newton with base units.

### Solution 37
**Problem**: What is the role of dimensional analysis in physics?  
- (a) To measure physical quantities  
- (b) To check equation consistency  
- (c) To calculate errors  
- (d) To convert units

**Solution**:  
Dimensional analysis checks if equations are consistent by comparing dimensions (e.g., $[\text{L}]$, $[\text{M}]$, $[\text{T}]$). For example, in $v = d / t$, both sides must have dimensions $[\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]$. It’s not for measuring quantities, calculating errors, or converting units directly (though it can assist in conversions).  
The answer is (b) To check equation consistency.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use dimensional analysis to verify formulas in exams. Common error: Assuming it’s for direct measurement.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the dimensions of power using base SI units.

**Solution**:  
Power is energy per unit time, $P = E / t$. Energy ($E$) is work, $W = F \cdot d$, where force $F = m a$. Mass ($m$): $[\text{M}]$, acceleration ($a = \frac{d}{t^2}$): $[\text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$. Thus:  
$F = [\text{M}] \cdot [\text{L} \text{T}^{-2}] = [\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$.  
Work: $W = F \cdot d = [\text{M} \text{L} \text{T}^{-2}] \cdot [\text{L}] = [\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2}]$.  
Time ($t$): $[\text{T}]$. Power:  
$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{[\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-2}]}{[\text{T}]} = [\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-3}]
$$  
The dimension of power is $[\text{M} \text{L}^2 \text{T}^{-3}]$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Break derived units into base dimensions step-by-step. Common error: Forgetting time’s exponent.

### Solution 52
**Problem**: Derive the dimensions of acceleration and express them in terms of base SI units.

**Solution**:  
Acceleration is change in velocity per unit time, $a = \Delta v / \Delta t$. Velocity ($v = d / t$): distance ($d$): $[\text{L}]$, time ($t$): $[\text{T}]$. Thus:  
$v = \frac{[\text{L}]}{[\text{T}]} = [\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]$.  
Acceleration: $a = \frac{v}{t}$, with $v = [\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]$, $t = [\text{T}]$. Thus:  
$$
a = \frac{[\text{L} \text{T}^{-1}]}{[\text{T}]} = [\text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]
$$  
The dimension of acceleration is $[\text{L} \text{T}^{-2}]$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Derive velocity first, then acceleration. Common error: Incorrect time exponent.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 66
**Problem**: Which of the following is a derived SI unit?  
- (a) Meter  
- (b) Kilogram  
- (c) Watt  
- (d) Second

**Solution**:  
Derived SI units are combinations of base units. The base SI units are meter ($m$), kilogram ($kg$), second ($s$), ampere ($A$), kelvin ($K$), mole ($mol$), and candela ($cd$).  
- Meter, kilogram, and second are base units.  
- Watt ($W = J/s = kg \cdot m^2 / s^3$) is derived from base units.  
The answer is (c) Watt.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Identify derived units by their dependence on base units. Common error: Assuming watt is a base unit.

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A length is measured as $5.60 \, m$ with an error of $\pm 0.04 \, m$. What is the percentage error?  
- (a) $0.7\%$  
- (b) $0.71\%$  
- (c) $0.8\%$  
- (d) $0.9\%$

**Solution**:  
Percentage error is given by:  
$$
\frac{\Delta x}{x} \times 100\%
$$  
Given $x = 5.60 \, m$, $\Delta x = 0.04 \, m$:  
$$
\frac{\Delta x}{x} = \frac{0.04}{5.60} = 0.007142857
$$  
Percentage error:  
$$
0.007142857 \times 100 = 0.7142857\% \approx 0.71\%
$$  
(2 significant figures).  
The answer is (b) $0.71\%$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use the measured value for the denominator. Common error: Rounding too early.
