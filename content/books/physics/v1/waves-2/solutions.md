## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: Calculate the speed of sound in air at 27°C ($\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 8.31 \, \text{J/mol·K}$, $M = 0.029 \, \text{kg/mol}$).  
- (a) $346 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $347 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $348 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $349 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by $v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}$, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and $M$ is the molar mass. Given $\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 8.31 \, \text{J/mol·K}$, $M = 0.029 \, \text{kg/mol}$, and temperature $T = 27 + 273 = 300 \, \text{K}$:  
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 8.31 \times 300}{0.029}}
$$  
First, compute the numerator: $1.4 \times 8.31 \times 300 = 3483$. Then divide by $M$: $\frac{3483}{0.029} \approx 120103.45$. Take the square root:  
$$
v = \sqrt{120103.45} \approx 346.56 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
Round to the nearest whole number (April 14, 2025): $v \approx 347 \, \text{m/s}$.  
The answer is (b) $347 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Always convert temperature to Kelvin for gas laws; speed increases with temperature as $v \propto \sqrt{T}$. Common error: Using Celsius directly, which underestimates the speed.

### Solution 5
**Problem**: A car moves at $25 \, \text{m/s}$ toward a stationary observer, emitting a horn at $400 \, \text{Hz}$ ($v = 340 \, \text{m/s}$). Calculate the observed frequency.  
- (a) $428 \, \text{Hz}$  
- (b) $429 \, \text{Hz}$  
- (c) $430 \, \text{Hz}$  
- (d) $431 \, \text{Hz}$

**Solution**:  
The Doppler effect for sound gives the observed frequency $f'$ as $f' = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \right)$, where $f$ is the source frequency, $v$ is the speed of sound, $v_o$ is the observer’s speed (positive toward the source), and $v_s$ is the source’s speed (positive away from the observer). Here, $f = 400 \, \text{Hz}$, $v = 340 \, \text{m/s}$, $v_o = 0$ (stationary observer), and $v_s = -25 \, \text{m/s}$ (car moving toward observer, so negative):  
$$
f' = 400 \left( \frac{340 + 0}{340 - (-25)} \right) = 400 \left( \frac{340}{365} \right)
$$  
Compute: $\frac{340}{365} \approx 0.9315$, so $f' = 400 \times \frac{340}{365} \approx 400 \times 1.0735 \approx 429.4 \, \text{Hz}$. Round to the nearest whole number: $f' \approx 429 \, \text{Hz}$.  
The answer is (b) $429 \, \text{Hz}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Source moving toward observer increases frequency; use negative $v_s$ for approach. Common error: Incorrect sign for $v_s$, reducing frequency instead of increasing it.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What type of wave is a sound wave?  
- (a) Transverse  
- (b) Longitudinal  
- (c) Electromagnetic  
- (d) Standing

**Solution**:  
Sound waves are mechanical waves that propagate through a medium (e.g., air, water) by causing particles to vibrate. In a sound wave, the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation, creating regions of compression (high pressure) and rarefaction (low pressure). This parallel motion classifies sound waves as **longitudinal waves**, distinguishing them from transverse waves where particle motion is perpendicular to the wave direction (e.g., waves on a string). Sound waves are not electromagnetic (they require a medium, unlike light) and are not inherently standing waves (though they can form standing waves in specific conditions, e.g., pipes).  
- (a) Incorrect: Transverse waves have perpendicular displacement (e.g., light waves).  
- (b) Correct: Sound waves are longitudinal, with particle motion parallel to propagation.  
- (c) Incorrect: Electromagnetic waves (e.g., light) don’t require a medium; sound does.  
- (d) Incorrect: Standing waves are a pattern, not a type of wave; sound waves can be traveling or standing.  
The answer is (b) Longitudinal.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Identify wave type by particle motion direction; sound waves are always longitudinal in fluids. Common error: Confusing sound with light, which is electromagnetic and transverse.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What does the Doppler effect describe?  
- (a) Change in wave speed  
- (b) Change in frequency due to relative motion  
- (c) Change in amplitude  
- (d) Change in wavelength only

**Solution**:  
The Doppler effect describes the apparent change in the frequency of a wave when there is relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. For sound waves, if the source moves toward the observer, the observed frequency increases (higher pitch); if it moves away, the frequency decreases (lower pitch). This is due to the compression or stretching of the wave’s wavelength as perceived by the observer, but the effect is described in terms of frequency change. The formula is $f' = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \right)$, showing frequency $f'$ depends on relative motion. Wave speed remains constant (set by the medium), amplitude is unaffected by motion, and while wavelength changes, the Doppler effect is defined by the frequency shift.  
- (a) Incorrect: Wave speed $v$ depends on the medium, not relative motion.  
- (b) Correct: Doppler effect describes the frequency change due to relative motion.  
- (c) Incorrect: Amplitude is unrelated to the Doppler effect; it may change with distance but not motion.  
- (d) Incorrect: Wavelength changes as a consequence, but the effect is defined by frequency shift.  
The answer is (b) Change in frequency due to relative motion.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Focus on frequency change in Doppler problems; wavelength changes inversely but isn’t the primary description. Common error: Assuming wave speed changes with motion—it doesn’t.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the speed of sound in a gas $v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}$.

**Solution**:  
Sound waves in a gas are longitudinal, propagating via compressions and rarefactions. We derive the speed of sound by considering a plane wave traveling in the positive $x$-direction through an ideal gas with pressure $P$ and density $\rho$. The speed depends on the gas’s elasticity and inertia.

Sound propagation in a gas is an adiabatic process (no heat exchange due to rapid oscillations). The bulk modulus $B$ for an adiabatic process in an ideal gas is $B = \gamma P$, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats, e.g., $\gamma \approx 1.4$ for air). The general speed of sound in a medium is given by $v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$. Substitute $B = \gamma P$:  
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}
$$

To confirm, consider the physics of wave propagation. A small element of gas experiences a pressure change $\Delta P$ due to the wave, causing a fractional volume change $\frac{\Delta V}{V}$. For an adiabatic process, $P V^\gamma = \text{constant}$. Differentiate: $\frac{dP}{P} + \gamma \frac{dV}{V} = 0$, so $B = -\frac{dP}{dV/V} = \gamma P$. Using Newton’s second law on a gas element (as in Chapter 16 for liquids), the wave equation $\frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2} = \frac{B}{\rho} \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}$ yields the same speed: $v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma P}{\rho}}$. This matches Problem 1, where $v = \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 8.31 \times 300}{0.029}} \approx 347 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Sound propagation is adiabatic, not isothermal; use $\gamma P$ for bulk modulus in gases. Common error: Using isothermal bulk modulus ($B = P$), underestimating $v$.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the Doppler effect formula for sound $f' = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \right)$.

**Solution**:  
The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency due to relative motion between a source and observer. Consider a sound wave with speed $v$ in the medium (e.g., air). Let the source emit frequency $f$, moving at speed $v_s$ (positive away from the observer), and the observer move at speed $v_o$ (positive toward the source).

**Step 1: Source Motion (Observer Stationary, $v_o = 0$)**  
If the source is stationary, it emits waves with wavelength $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$, and the observer hears frequency $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$. When the source moves away at speed $v_s$, the wave crests are emitted from positions farther apart. In one period $T = \frac{1}{f}$, the source moves $v_s T = \frac{v_s}{f}$. The wavelength observed increases: $\lambda' = \lambda + \frac{v_s}{f} = \frac{v}{f} + \frac{v_s}{f} = \frac{v + v_s}{f}$. The observer, stationary relative to the medium, perceives the wave speed as $v$, so the observed frequency is:  
$$
f' = \frac{v}{\lambda'} = \frac{v}{\frac{v + v_s}{f}} = f \frac{v}{v + v_s}
$$  
Generalize for any $v_s$: $f' = f \left( \frac{v}{v - v_s} \right)$ (negative $v_s$ for source approaching).

**Step 2: Observer Motion (Source Stationary, $v_s = 0$)**  
Now, the source is stationary, so $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$. The observer moves at speed $v_o$ toward the source. The relative speed of the wave crests toward the observer is $v + v_o$ (since the observer approaches the wave). The observer encounters crests at a rate:  
$$
f' = \frac{\text{relative speed}}{\lambda} = \frac{v + v_o}{\frac{v}{f}} = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v} \right)
$$

**Step 3: General Case**  
Combine both effects: the source motion modifies the wavelength to $\lambda' = \frac{v - v_s}{f}$, and the observer perceives the wave at relative speed $v + v_o$. The observed frequency is:  
$$
f' = \frac{v + v_o}{\lambda'} = \frac{v + v_o}{\frac{v - v_s}{f}} = f \left( \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s} \right)
$$  
This matches Problem 5: $f' = 400 \left( \frac{340}{340 - (-25)} \right) \approx 429 \, \text{Hz}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Sign convention is critical: $v_s$ is positive away from the observer, $v_o$ positive toward the source. Common error: Forgetting relative motion of the observer, omitting $v_o$.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A sound wave in air at 20°C ($\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 8.31 \, \text{J/mol·K}$, $M = 0.029 \, \text{kg/mol}$) propagates. What is the speed?  
- (a) $342 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $343 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $344 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $345 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The speed of sound in a gas is $v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}$. Given $\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 8.31 \, \text{J/mol·K}$, $M = 0.029 \, \text{kg/mol}$, and $T = 20 + 273 = 293 \, \text{K}$:  
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 8.31 \times 293}{0.029}}
$$  
Numerator: $1.4 \times 8.31 \times 293 \approx 3408.342$. Divide by $M$: $\frac{3408.342}{0.029} \approx 117528.69$. Take the square root: $v = \sqrt{117528.69} \approx 342.83 \, \text{m/s}$. Round to the nearest whole number: $v \approx 343 \, \text{m/s}$.  
The answer is (b) $343 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Speed of sound in air at 20°C is typically ~343 m/s; verify with the formula. Common error: Not converting temperature to Kelvin, leading to a lower speed.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A sound wave has $p_0 = 0.2 \, \text{Pa}$ in air ($\rho = 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3$, $v = 340 \, \text{m/s}$). What is the intensity?  
- (a) $4.88 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$  
- (b) $4.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$  
- (c) $4.90 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$  
- (d) $4.91 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$

**Solution**:  
The intensity of a sound wave is given by $I = \frac{p_0^2}{2 \rho v}$, where $p_0$ is the pressure amplitude, $\rho$ is the density of the medium, and $v$ is the speed of sound. Given $p_0 = 0.2 \, \text{Pa}$, $\rho = 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3$, $v = 340 \, \text{m/s}$:  
$$
I = \frac{(0.2)^2}{2 \times 1.2 \times 340} = \frac{0.04}{2 \times 1.2 \times 340}
$$  
Denominator: $2 \times 1.2 \times 340 = 816$. So:  
$$
I = \frac{0.04}{816} \approx 4.902 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2
$$  
Round to three significant figures: $I \approx 4.90 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$.  
The answer is (c) $4.90 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W/m}^2$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Intensity scales with $p_0^2$; units work out to W/m² (Pa² over kg/m³·m/s). Common error: Forgetting the factor of 2, doubling the intensity.
