# Force and Motion—II Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of advanced force and motion concepts, including static and kinetic friction, circular motion dynamics (centripetal force, banking), drag forces and terminal velocity, and applications in complex systems (e.g., pulley systems with friction, non-inertial frames). Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering advanced dynamics, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
