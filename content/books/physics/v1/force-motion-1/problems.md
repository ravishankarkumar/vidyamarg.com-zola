# Force and Motion—I Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of force and motion, including Newton’s laws, the concept of force, applications in linear motion (e.g., blocks, pulleys), and inertial/non-inertial frames. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering dynamics, a core topic for JEE/NEET success.
