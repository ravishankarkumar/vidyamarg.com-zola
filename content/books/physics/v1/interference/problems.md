# Interference Problems

This section provides **100 problems** to test your understanding of interference of light, including calculations of resultant amplitude, fringe spacing, path difference, thin film thickness, and intensity distribution, as well as applications like interferometry and anti-reflective coatings. Inspired by JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET exam patterns, these problems are tailored for exam preparation, offering a mix of numerical, conceptual, and derivation-based challenges. NEET-style problems (66–100) are formatted as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to match the exam’s objective format. Problems are organized by type to support progressive learning and build confidence in mastering wave optics, a key topic for JEE/NEET success.
