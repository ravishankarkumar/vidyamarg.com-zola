These solutions are designed to help JEE Main, JEE Advanced, and NEET students understand key concepts and problem-solving techniques. Each solution includes detailed steps, exam-focused tips to avoid common mistakes, and alignment with JEE/NEET exam patterns. Full solutions for all 100 problems will be available in June 2025.

## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A wave on a string has tension $T = 200 \, \text{N}$ and linear mass density $\mu = 0.04 \, \text{kg/m}$. Calculate the wave speed.  
- (a) $69 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $70 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $71 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $72 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The speed of a transverse wave on a string is given by the formula $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$, where $T$ is the tension in the string and $\mu$ is the linear mass density. Given $T = 200 \, \text{N}$ and $\mu = 0.04 \, \text{kg/m}$:  
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{200}{0.04}}
$$  
Compute the fraction: $\frac{200}{0.04} = 5000$. Then take the square root:  
$$
v = \sqrt{5000} \approx 70.71 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
Round to the nearest whole number (April 14, 2025): $v \approx 71 \, \text{m/s}$.  
The answer is (c) $71 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Wave speed on a string depends only on $T$ and $\mu$, not on frequency or wavelength. Ensure units are consistent: $T$ in N, $\mu$ in kg/m, so $v$ is in m/s. Common error: Forgetting to take the square root, leading to an incorrect speed.

### Solution 5
**Problem**: A wave is described by $y = 0.03 \sin(6 \pi x - 1200 \pi t)$ (in SI units). Calculate the wave speed.  
- (a) $195 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $200 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $205 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $210 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The wave equation is given in the form $y = A \sin(k x - \omega t)$, where $k$ is the wave number and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. For the given wave $y = 0.03 \sin(6 \pi x - 1200 \pi t)$, identify the coefficients: $k = 6 \pi \, \text{rad/m}$, $\omega = 1200 \pi \, \text{rad/s}$. The wave speed $v$ is given by:  
$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1200 \pi}{6 \pi}
$$  
Simplify:  
$$
v = \frac{1200}{6} = 200 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
The answer is (b) $200 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: In the wave equation $y = A \sin(k x - \omega t)$, $k$ is the coefficient of $x$, and $\omega$ is the coefficient of $t$. The wave speed is always $v = \frac{\omega}{k}$, not the particle speed. Common error: Confusing wave speed with particle speed, which would require $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What distinguishes a transverse wave from a longitudinal wave?  
- (a) Transverse waves travel faster  
- (b) Transverse waves have displacement perpendicular to propagation, longitudinal parallel  
- (c) Longitudinal waves require a medium  
- (d) Transverse waves have higher frequency

**Solution**:  
Transverse and longitudinal waves are distinguished by the direction of particle displacement relative to the direction of wave propagation. In a **transverse wave**, the displacement of the medium's particles is perpendicular to the direction the wave travels—for example, in a wave on a string or an electromagnetic wave, where crests and troughs are visible. In a **longitudinal wave**, the displacement is parallel to the direction of propagation—for example, in a sound wave, where compressions and rarefactions occur as particles oscillate along the direction of wave travel.  
- (a) Incorrect: Wave speed depends on the medium, not the wave type; transverse and longitudinal waves can have varying speeds (e.g., light vs. sound).  
- (b) Correct: This is the fundamental distinction—transverse waves have perpendicular displacement, longitudinal waves have parallel displacement.  
- (c) Incorrect: Both types can require a medium (mechanical waves), but electromagnetic transverse waves (e.g., light) do not.  
- (d) Incorrect: Frequency depends on the source, not the wave type; both can have any frequency.  
The answer is (b) Transverse waves have displacement perpendicular to propagation, longitudinal parallel.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Focus on the direction of particle motion relative to wave propagation to classify waves. Common error: Assuming all waves requiring a medium are longitudinal—transverse waves on a string also need a medium.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What condition leads to constructive interference?  
- (a) Phase difference of $\pi$  
- (b) Phase difference of $2 \pi$  
- (c) Path difference of $\lambda/2$  
- (d) Different amplitudes

**Solution**:  
Constructive interference occurs when two waves superpose to produce a larger amplitude, which happens when the waves are in phase. For two waves $y_1 = A \sin(k x - \omega t)$ and $y_2 = A \sin(k x - \omega t + \phi)$, the resultant amplitude is maximized when the phase difference $\phi$ is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ (i.e., $\phi = 2 \pi n$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$). This corresponds to a path difference $\Delta x = n \lambda$, since $\phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \Delta x$. When $\phi = 2 \pi$, the path difference is $\Delta x = \lambda$, and the waves add fully in phase.  
- (a) Incorrect: A phase difference of $\pi$ leads to destructive interference (out of phase).  
- (b) Correct: $\phi = 2 \pi$ means the waves are in phase, causing constructive interference.  
- (c) Incorrect: A path difference of $\lambda/2$ corresponds to $\phi = \pi$, leading to destructive interference.  
- (d) Incorrect: Different amplitudes affect the resultant amplitude but aren’t the condition for constructive interference—phase matters.  
The answer is (b) Phase difference of $2 \pi$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Constructive interference occurs when $\phi = 2 \pi n$ or $\Delta x = n \lambda$; destructive occurs at $\phi = (2n+1) \pi$. Common error: Confusing phase and path difference—convert between them using $\phi = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \Delta x$.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the wave speed on a string $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$.

**Solution**:  
Consider a transverse wave on a string with tension $T$ (in N) and linear mass density $\mu$ (in kg/m). We derive the wave speed by analyzing a small segment of the string of length $\Delta l$, which is displaced into an arc due to the wave. Assume the wave travels in the positive $x$-direction, and the displacement $y(x, t)$ forms a small angle $\theta$ with the horizontal at each end of the segment.

The tension $T$ acts along the string at both ends of the segment, at positions $x$ and $x + \Delta x$. The vertical component of the tension provides the net force causing transverse acceleration. At position $x$, the angle $\theta(x)$ gives a vertical force component $T \sin \theta(x)$, acting downward if $\theta$ is positive. At $x + \Delta x$, the force is $T \sin \theta(x + \Delta x)$, acting in the opposite direction. For small angles, $\sin \theta \approx \theta$, and $\theta \approx \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ (the slope of the string).

The net vertical force on the segment is:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} = T \sin \theta(x + \Delta x) - T \sin \theta(x) \approx T \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x + \Delta x} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \bigg|_x \right)
$$  
Approximate the difference:  
$$
F_{\text{net}} \approx T \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \bigg|_{x + \Delta x} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \bigg|_x \right) \approx T \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \Delta x
$$  
The mass of the segment is $\mu \Delta x$, and its vertical acceleration is $\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}$. Apply Newton’s second law:  
$$
(\mu \Delta x) \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = T \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \Delta x
$$  
Cancel $\Delta x$ (since $\Delta x \neq 0$):  
$$
\mu \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = T \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
$$  
Rearrange:  
$$
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = \frac{T}{\mu} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
$$  
This is the wave equation, $\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$, so:  
$$
v^2 = \frac{T}{\mu} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
$$  
This matches Problem 1: $v = \sqrt{\frac{200}{0.04}} = \sqrt{5000} \approx 71 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The derivation assumes small displacements and constant tension; $v$ depends only on $T$ and $\mu$. Common error: Misapplying forces—ensure only the vertical components contribute to transverse motion.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the wave speed of sound in a medium $v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$.

**Solution**:  
Sound waves are longitudinal waves that propagate through a medium (e.g., air, water) via compressions and rarefactions. We derive the speed of sound in a fluid medium with bulk modulus $B$ (in Pa) and density $\rho$ (in kg/m³). The bulk modulus measures the medium’s elasticity, defined as $B = -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V}$, where $\Delta P$ is the pressure change and $\Delta V / V$ is the fractional volume change (negative sign because volume decreases as pressure increases).

Consider a plane sound wave traveling in the positive $x$-direction through a fluid. The wave causes a small displacement $\xi(x, t)$ of particles along the $x$-axis. The displacement at position $x$ is $\xi(x, t)$, and at $x + \Delta x$, it is $\xi(x + \Delta x, t)$. The change in displacement over $\Delta x$ causes a volume change. For a small element of cross-sectional area $A$ and length $\Delta x$, the original volume is $V = A \Delta x$. The new length after displacement is $\Delta x + \xi(x + \Delta x) - \xi(x)$, so the fractional volume change is:  
$$
\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{A [\Delta x + \xi(x + \Delta x) - \xi(x)] - A \Delta x}{A \Delta x} = \frac{\xi(x + \Delta x) - \xi(x)}{\Delta x} \approx \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}
$$  
The pressure change due to this compression is:  
$$
\Delta P = - B \frac{\Delta V}{V} \approx - B \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}
$$  
Now, apply Newton’s second law to the fluid element. The mass of the element is $\rho A \Delta x$, and its acceleration is $\frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2}$. The net force is due to the pressure difference across the element: $F = P(x) A - P(x + \Delta x) A \approx - \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} A \Delta x$. Substitute $\Delta P = - B \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial x}$, so $\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = - B \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}$. Thus, the force is:  
$$
F = - \left(- B \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}\right) A \Delta x = B \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2} A \Delta x
$$  
Newton’s second law gives:  
$$
(\rho A \Delta x) \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2} = B \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2} A \Delta x
$$  
Cancel $A \Delta x$:  
$$
\rho \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2} = B \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}
$$  
This is the wave equation, $\frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}$, so:  
$$
v^2 = \frac{B}{\rho} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
$$  
This matches Problem 3: $v = \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 10^5}{1.2}} \approx 342 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The speed of sound depends on the medium’s elasticity ($B$) and inertia ($\rho$); for solids, include shear modulus if transverse waves are considered. Common error: Forgetting the negative sign in the bulk modulus definition, leading to incorrect force direction.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A wave on a string has $T = 50 \, \text{N}$ and $\mu = 0.01 \, \text{kg/m}$. What is the wave speed?  
- (a) $69 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $70 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $71 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $72 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The wave speed on a string is given by $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$. Given $T = 50 \, \text{N}$ and $\mu = 0.01 \, \text{kg/m}$:  
$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{50}{0.01}} = \sqrt{5000} \approx 70.71 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
Round to the nearest whole number: $v \approx 71 \, \text{m/s}$.  
The answer is (c) $71 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Ensure units are consistent in $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$; the result is in m/s. Common error: Not rounding to match the options—use significant figures appropriately (April 14, 2025).

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A wave $y = 0.02 \sin(4 x - 800 t)$ (in SI units) propagates. What is the particle velocity at $x = 0$, $t = 0$?  
- (a) $-16 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $0 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $16 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $32 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
The particle velocity in a wave is the time derivative of the displacement, $v_{\text{particle}} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$. Given $y = 0.02 \sin(4 x - 800 t)$, differentiate with respect to $t$:  
$$
v_{\text{particle}} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0.02 \times (-800) \cos(4 x - 800 t) = -16 \cos(4 x - 800 t) \, \text{m/s}
$$  
Evaluate at $x = 0$, $t = 0$:  
$$
v_{\text{particle}} = -16 \cos(4 \times 0 - 800 \times 0) = -16 \cos(0) = -16 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
The answer is (a) $-16 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Particle velocity is $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$, not the wave speed $v = \frac{\omega}{k}$. Evaluate the cosine term carefully at the given point. Common error: Confusing particle velocity with wave speed, which would be $\frac{800}{4} = 200 \, \text{m/s}$.
