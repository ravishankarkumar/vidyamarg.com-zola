## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: A spring-mass system has $m = 0.8 \, \text{kg}$ and $k = 320 \, \text{N/m}$. Calculate the period of oscillation.  
- (a) $0.30 \, \text{s}$  
- (b) $0.31 \, \text{s}$  
- (c) $0.32 \, \text{s}$  
- (d) $0.33 \, \text{s}$

**Solution**:  
The period of a spring-mass system in simple harmonic motion (SHM) is given by $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$, where $m$ is the mass and $k$ is the spring constant. Given $m = 0.8 \, \text{kg}$ and $k = 320 \, \text{N/m}$:  
$$
T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{0.8}{320}}
$$  
First, compute the fraction: $\frac{0.8}{320} = 0.0025$. Then, take the square root: $\sqrt{0.0025} = 0.05$. So:  
$$
T = 2 \pi \times 0.05 \approx 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.05 \approx 0.31416 \, \text{s}
$$  
Round to two decimal places (April 14, 2025): $T \approx 0.31 \, \text{s}$.  
The answer is (b) $0.31 \, \text{s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The period in SHM depends only on $m$ and $k$, not amplitude. Ensure units are consistent ($m$ in kg, $k$ in N/m). Common error: Forgetting to take the square root, leading to an incorrect $T$.

### Solution 4
**Problem**: A spring-mass system ($m = 0.3 \, \text{kg}$, $k = 150 \, \text{N/m}$, $A = 0.08 \, \text{m}$) oscillates. Calculate the total energy.  
- (a) $0.45 \, \text{J}$  
- (b) $0.46 \, \text{J}$  
- (c) $0.47 \, \text{J}$  
- (d) $0.48 \, \text{J}$

**Solution**:  
The total energy in a spring-mass system undergoing SHM is conserved and given by $E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $A$ is the amplitude. Given $k = 150 \, \text{N/m}$ and $A = 0.08 \, \text{m}$:  
$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \times 150 \times (0.08)^2
$$  
Compute: $(0.08)^2 = 0.0064$, then $\frac{1}{2} \times 150 = 75$, so $E = 75 \times 0.0064 = 0.48 \, \text{J}$.  
The answer is (d) $0.48 \, \text{J}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Total energy depends on amplitude and spring constant, not mass; units are joules (N/m times m²). Common error: Using $x$ instead of $A$ for total energy, which gives potential energy at a specific position.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: What condition defines simple harmonic motion (SHM)?  
- (a) Acceleration is constant  
- (b) Acceleration is proportional to velocity  
- (c) Acceleration is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction  
- (d) Acceleration is independent of displacement

**Solution**:  
Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a type of periodic motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and acts in the opposite direction. According to Newton’s second law, $F = m a$, and for SHM, the force is $F = -k x$ (e.g., in a spring-mass system). Thus, $m a = -k x$, or $a = -\frac{k}{m} x$. This shows that acceleration $a$ is proportional to displacement $x$ (via the constant $-\frac{k}{m}$) and opposite in direction (due to the negative sign). The general form is $a = -\omega^2 x$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.  
- (a) Incorrect: Acceleration in SHM varies with position, not constant.  
- (b) Incorrect: Acceleration is proportional to displacement, not velocity (velocity dependence occurs in damping).  
- (c) Correct: $a \propto -x$, defining SHM.  
- (d) Incorrect: Acceleration depends on displacement in SHM.  
The answer is (c) Acceleration is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The defining condition for SHM is $a = -\omega^2 x$; look for a linear restoring force. Common error: Confusing SHM with other motions where acceleration might be constant (e.g., uniform acceleration).

### Solution 38
**Problem**: What happens to the frequency of a simple pendulum if its length is doubled?  
- (a) Increases by a factor of 2  
- (b) Decreases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$  
- (c) Decreases by a factor of 2  
- (d) Remains the same

**Solution**:  
The period of a simple pendulum (for small angles) is $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$, where $L$ is the length and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Frequency is the inverse of period: $f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$. If the length $L$ is doubled to $2L$, the new frequency $f'$ is:  
$$
f' = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{2L}}
$$  
Compare with the original frequency $f$:  
$$
\frac{f'}{f} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{g}{2L}}}{\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{2L} \cdot \frac{L}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
$$  
Thus, the frequency decreases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.  
- (a) Incorrect: Frequency decreases, does not increase.  
- (b) Correct: Frequency scales as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ when $L$ is doubled.  
- (c) Incorrect: Frequency decreases by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, not $\frac{1}{2}$ (which would be if $T$ scaled linearly with $L$).  
- (d) Incorrect: Frequency changes with length in a pendulum.  
The answer is (b) Decreases by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Frequency is inversely proportional to $\sqrt{L}$; doubling $L$ increases $T$ by $\sqrt{2}$, reducing $f$ by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Common error: Assuming $T \propto L$, which would incorrectly suggest $f$ decreases by a factor of 2.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 51
**Problem**: Derive the equation of motion for SHM $a = -\omega^2 x$.

**Solution**:  
Consider a spring-mass system, a classic example of SHM. A mass $m$ is attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. When displaced by $x$ from equilibrium, the spring exerts a restoring force given by Hooke’s law: $F = -k x$, where the negative sign indicates the force acts opposite to the displacement, toward equilibrium. Apply Newton’s second law, $F = m a$, where $a$ is the acceleration:  
$$
m a = -k x
$$  
Divide through by $m$:  
$$
a = -\frac{k}{m} x
$$  
This matches the form of SHM, $a = -\omega^2 x$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency. Equate the coefficients:  
$$
\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$  
Thus, the equation of motion for SHM is $a = -\omega^2 x$, with $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$. This is used in Problem 1 to find $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{0.8}{320}} \approx 0.31 \, \text{s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: The SHM equation $a = -\omega^2 x$ applies to any system with a linear restoring force; identify $\omega$ based on the system (e.g., $\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ for springs). Common error: Forgetting the negative sign, which defines the oscillatory nature of SHM.

### Solution 53
**Problem**: Derive the total energy in SHM $E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$.

**Solution**:  
In SHM, total mechanical energy is conserved (assuming no damping). Consider a spring-mass system with mass $m$, spring constant $k$, and amplitude $A$. The position is $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$, where $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$.  

- **Potential Energy**: The potential energy in a spring is $U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$. At maximum displacement ($x = A$), $U_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$.  
- **Kinetic Energy**: Velocity is $v = \frac{dx}{dt} = -A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi)$. Kinetic energy is $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi))^2$. At $x = 0$, $v = \pm A \omega$, so $K_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2} m (A \omega)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m A^2 \frac{k}{m} = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$.  
- **Total Energy**: Energy conservation gives $E = K + U$. At $x = A$, $K = 0$, $U = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$, so $E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$. At $x = 0$, $U = 0$, $K = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$, so $E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$. Generally:  
$$
E = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} k (A \cos(\omega t + \phi))^2 + \frac{1}{2} m (A \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi))^2
$$  
Substitute $\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}$, simplify using $\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$, and confirm $E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2$, as used in Problem 4 ($E = \frac{1}{2} \times 150 \times (0.08)^2 = 0.48 \, \text{J}$).  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Total energy is constant in ideal SHM; use $A$ for maximum energy calculations. Common error: Confusing $x$ with $A$ when calculating total energy.

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: A spring-mass system has $m = 0.4 \, \text{kg}$ and $k = 160 \, \text{N/m}$. What is the period of oscillation?  
- (a) $0.31 \, \text{s}$  
- (b) $0.32 \, \text{s}$  
- (c) $0.33 \, \text{s}$  
- (d) $0.34 \, \text{s}$

**Solution**:  
The period of a spring-mass system in SHM is $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$. Given $m = 0.4 \, \text{kg}$ and $k = 160 \, \text{N/m}$:  
$$
T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{0.4}{160}}
$$  
Compute: $\frac{0.4}{160} = 0.0025$, $\sqrt{0.0025} = 0.05$, so $T = 2 \pi \times 0.05 \approx 2 \times 3.1416 \times 0.05 \approx 0.31416 \, \text{s}$. Round to two decimal places: $T \approx 0.31 \, \text{s}$.  
The answer is (a) $0.31 \, \text{s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Period calculations are straightforward with $T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$; double-check the square root. Common error: Not rounding appropriately for the given options.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A mass of $0.2 \, \text{kg}$ on a spring ($k = 80 \, \text{N/m}$) has $A = 0.05 \, \text{m}$. What is the maximum velocity?  
- (a) $0.95 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (b) $1.00 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (c) $1.05 \, \text{m/s}$  
- (d) $1.10 \, \text{m/s}$

**Solution**:  
In SHM, the maximum velocity occurs at the equilibrium position ($x = 0$) and is given by $v_{\text{max}} = A \omega$, where $A$ is the amplitude and $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ is the angular frequency. Given $m = 0.2 \, \text{kg}$, $k = 80 \, \text{N/m}$, $A = 0.05 \, \text{m}$:  
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{80}{0.2}} = \sqrt{400} = 20 \, \text{rad/s}
$$  
Then:  
$$
v_{\text{max}} = A \omega = 0.05 \times 20 = 1.00 \, \text{m/s}
$$  
The answer is (b) $1.00 \, \text{m/s}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Maximum velocity is at $x = 0$; use $A \omega$ directly after computing $\omega$. Common error: Forgetting to calculate $\omega$ or using $x$ instead of $A$.
