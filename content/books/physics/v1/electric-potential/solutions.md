## Numerical Solutions

### Solution 1
**Problem**: Calculate the electric potential at a distance $r = 0.2 \, \text{m}$ from a point charge $Q = 5 \, \mu\text{C}$ ($k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$).  
- (a) $2.24 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$  
- (b) $2.25 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$  
- (c) $2.26 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$  
- (d) $2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$

**Solution**:  
The electric potential due to a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ is given by $V = k \frac{Q}{r}$, where $k$ is Coulomb’s constant, $Q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge to the point. Given $Q = 5 \, \mu\text{C} = 5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}$, $r = 0.2 \, \text{m}$, and $k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$:  
$$
V = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{5 \times 10^{-6}}{0.2} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{5 \times 10^{-6}}{0.2} = 9 \times 10^9 \times 2.5 \times 10^{-5} = 2.25 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}
$$
The answer is (b) $2.25 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Potential is a scalar, so no direction is needed; ensure units are consistent (e.g., convert $\mu\text{C}$ to C). Common error: Using the electric field formula ($E \propto 1/r^2$) instead of the potential formula ($V \propto 1/r$).

### Solution 3
**Problem**: Calculate the potential energy of two charges $q_1 = 4 \, \mu\text{C}$ and $q_2 = -2 \, \mu\text{C}$ separated by $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$.  
- (a) $-0.719 \, \text{J}$  
- (b) $-0.720 \, \text{J}$  
- (c) $-0.721 \, \text{J}$  
- (d) $-0.722 \, \text{J}$

**Solution**:  
The potential energy $U$ of a pair of point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by $U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$, where $k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$. Given $q_1 = 4 \, \mu\text{C} = 4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}$, $q_2 = -2 \, \mu\text{C} = -2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}$, and $r = 0.1 \, \text{m}$:  
$$
U = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{(4 \times 10^{-6}) \times (-2 \times 10^{-6})}{0.1} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{-8 \times 10^{-12}}{0.1} = 9 \times 10^9 \times (-8 \times 10^{-11}) = -7.2 \times 10^{-2} = -0.720 \, \text{J}
$$
The answer is (b) $-0.720 \, \text{J}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Include the signs of the charges; a negative $U$ indicates an attractive force (unlike charges). Common error: Forgetting the sign of $U$, or using incorrect units for $r$ or $q$.

## Conceptual Solutions

### Solution 66
**Problem**: What is the unit of electric potential in SI units?  
- (a) Volt  
- (b) Joule  
- (c) Newton/Coulomb  
- (d) Watt

**Solution**:  
Electric potential $V$ at a point is defined as the potential energy per unit charge, $V = \frac{U}{q}$, where $U$ is the potential energy (in joules, J) and $q$ is the charge (in coulombs, C). Thus, the unit of electric potential is joules per coulomb (J/C), which is defined as a volt (V) in SI units. A volt is the standard unit for electric potential, commonly used in electrostatics problems. Joules measure energy, not potential; newton per coulomb (N/C) is the unit for electric field $E$; and watt (J/s) measures power, not potential.  
- (a) Correct: The unit of electric potential is volt (V), equivalent to J/C.  
- (b) Incorrect: Joule (J) is the unit of energy, not potential.  
- (c) Incorrect: Newton per coulomb (N/C) is the unit of electric field, not potential (though dimensionally equivalent to V/m).  
- (d) Incorrect: Watt (W) is the unit of power (J/s), not potential.  
The answer is (a) Volt.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Electric potential is measured in volts; distinguish it from energy (J) and field (N/C), though they’re related ($V = Ed$ in uniform fields). Common error: Confusing potential with potential energy, which uses joules.

### Solution 68
**Problem**: What does the principle of superposition state for electric potential?  
- (a) Potentials are vectors  
- (b) Potentials add as scalars  
- (c) Potentials cancel out  
- (d) Potentials are independent of distance

**Solution**:  
The principle of superposition for electric potential states that the total potential at a point due to multiple charges is the algebraic sum of the potentials due to each charge individually, because potential is a scalar quantity. For charges $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ at distances $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$ from a point, the total potential is $V = V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n = k \sum \frac{q_i}{r_i}$. Unlike electric fields, which are vectors and require vector addition, potentials add directly as scalars, considering only their magnitudes and signs (positive for positive charges, negative for negative charges). Potentials do not always cancel out (depends on signs and positions), and they are not independent of distance ($V \propto 1/r$).  
- (a) Incorrect: Potentials are scalars, not vectors; fields are vectors.  
- (b) Correct: Potentials add as scalars, considering their signs.  
- (c) Incorrect: Potentials may or may not cancel, depending on the charges (e.g., Problem 2, $V = 0$).  
- (d) Incorrect: Potential depends on distance ($V \propto 1/r$), not independent.  
The answer is (b) Potentials add as scalars.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Add potentials algebraically, including signs; no vector components are needed. Common error: Treating potentials like fields and attempting vector addition, which overcomplicates the problem.

## Derivation Solutions

### Solution 36
**Problem**: Derive the electric potential due to a point charge $V = k \frac{Q}{r}$.

**Solution**:  
Electric potential $V$ at a point due to a charge is defined as the work done per unit charge to bring a test charge from infinity to that point, or equivalently, $V = -\int_{\infty}^{r} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$, where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field due to the charge, and the path is from infinity to distance $r$.

For a point charge $Q$ at the origin, the electric field is $\vec{E} = k \frac{Q}{r'^2} \hat{r}$, where $k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$, and $r'$ is the radial distance. Choose a radial path from infinity to $r$, so $d\vec{l} = dr' \hat{r}$ (inward, toward the charge, so $dr'$ is negative as $r'$ decreases). Since $\vec{E}$ and $d\vec{l}$ are parallel, $\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = E dr' = \left( k \frac{Q}{r'^2} \right) dr'$. Integrate:  
$$
V = -\int_{\infty}^{r} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -\int_{\infty}^{r} \left( k \frac{Q}{r'^2} \right) dr' = -k Q \left[ -\frac{1}{r'} \right]_{\infty}^{r} = -k Q \left( -\frac{1}{r} - 0 \right) = k \frac{Q}{r}
$$
This matches the given expression. The potential is zero at infinity, and $V$ is positive for $Q > 0$, negative for $Q < 0$. For Problem 1, $Q = 5 \, \mu\text{C}$, $r = 0.2 \, \text{m}$, $V = 2.25 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Integrate along a path where $\vec{E}$ and $d\vec{l}$ align; the negative sign in $V = -\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$ accounts for the field direction. Common error: Forgetting the negative sign, or using an incorrect path.

### Solution 38
**Problem**: Derive the work done by the electric field $W = q (V_a - V_b)$.

**Solution**:  
The work done by the electric field on a charge $q$ moving between two points is related to the potential difference between those points. The electric field is conservative, so the work done depends only on the potential difference, not the path taken.

The potential difference between points $a$ and $b$ is defined as $V_b - V_a = -\int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$, where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field, and the integral is along any path from $a$ to $b$. The work done by the field on a charge $q$ moving from $a$ to $b$ is $W = \int_a^b \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{l}$, where $\vec{F} = q \vec{E}$. Thus:  
$$
W = \int_a^b (q \vec{E}) \cdot d\vec{l} = q \int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}
$$
Since $\int_a^b \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -(V_b - V_a) = V_a - V_b$, we have:  
$$
W = q (V_a - V_b)
$$
This is the work done by the field. If $V_a > V_b$, $W$ is positive, meaning the field does positive work (e.g., moving a positive charge toward a lower potential). For Problem 4, $q = 1 \, \mu\text{C}$, $V_a = 200 \, \text{V}$, $V_b = 100 \, \text{V}$, $W = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{J}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Work done by the field is positive when moving from higher to lower potential; the conservative nature ensures path independence. Common error: Confusing the direction of work (field vs. external agent).

## NEET-style Solutions

### Solution 96
**Problem**: Calculate the potential at $r = 0.4 \, \text{m}$ from a point charge $Q = 2 \, \mu\text{C}$.  
- (a) $4.49 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}$  
- (b) $4.50 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}$  
- (c) $4.51 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}$  
- (d) $4.52 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}$

**Solution**:  
The electric potential due to a point charge is $V = k \frac{Q}{r}$. Given $Q = 2 \, \mu\text{C} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}$, $r = 0.4 \, \text{m}$, $k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$:  
$$
V = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{0.4} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{0.4} = 9 \times 10^9 \times 5 \times 10^{-6} = 4.5 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}
$$
The answer is (b) $4.50 \times 10^4 \, \text{V}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Potential decreases as $1/r$; ensure proper unit conversion for $Q$. Common error: Using the field formula or incorrect powers of 10.

### Solution 98
**Problem**: A capacitor with $C = 15 \, \mu\text{F}$ is charged to $V = 60 \, \text{V}$. Calculate the energy stored.  
- (a) $2.69 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}$  
- (b) $2.70 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}$  
- (c) $2.71 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}$  
- (d) $2.72 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}$

**Solution**:  
The energy stored in a capacitor is given by $U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$, where $C$ is the capacitance and $V$ is the potential difference across the capacitor. Given $C = 15 \, \mu\text{F} = 15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F}$, $V = 60 \, \text{V}$:  
$$
U = \frac{1}{2} \times (15 \times 10^{-6}) \times (60)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 10^{-6} \times 3600 = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 3600 \times 10^{-6} = 7.5 \times 3600 \times 10^{-6} = 27000 \times 10^{-6} = 0.027 = 2.70 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}
$$
The answer is (b) $2.70 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{J}$.  
- **JEE/NEET Tip**: Use $U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$ for energy; convert $C$ to farads and compute carefully. Common error: Forgetting the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$, or incorrect unit conversion for $C$.
